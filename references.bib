	abstract = {We report on the successful implementation of a high-resolution vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser pulsed field ionization-photoion (PFI-PI) detection method for the study of unimolecular dissociation of quantum-state- or energy-selected molecular ions. As a test case, we have determined the 0 K appearance energy (AE0) for the formation of methylium, CH3+, from methane, CH4, as AE0(CH3+/CH4) = 14.32271 ± 0.00013 eV. This value has a significantly smaller error limit, but is otherwise consistent with previous laboratory and/or synchrotron-based studies of this dissociative photoionization onset. Furthermore, the sum of the VUV laser PFI-PI spectra obtained for the parent CH4+ ion and the fragment CH3+ ions of methane is found to agree with the earlier VUV pulsed field ionization-photoelectron (VUV-PFI-PE) spectrum of methane, providing unambiguous validation of the previous interpretation that the sharp VUV-PFI-PE step observed at the AE0(CH3+/CH4) threshold ensues because of higher PFI detection efficiency for fragment CH3+ than for parent CH4+. This, in turn, is a consequence of the underlying high-n Rydberg dissociation mechanism for the dissociative photoionization of CH4, which was proposed in previous synchrotron-based VUV-PFI-PE and VUV-PFI-PEPICO studies of CH4. The present highly accurate 0 K dissociative ionization threshold for CH4 can be utilized to derive accurate values for the bond dissociation energies of methane and methane cation. For methane, the straightforward application of sequential thermochemistry via the positive ion cycle leads to some ambiguity because of two competing VUV-PFI-PE literature values for the ionization energy of methyl radical. The ambiguity is successfully resolved by applying the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) approach, resulting in D0(H–CH3) = 432.463 ± 0.027 kJ mol−1 and D0(H–CH3+) = 164.701 ± 0.038 kJ mol−1.},

We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent and primary settled solids in two wastewater treatment plants to inform the preanalytical and analytical approaches and to assess whether influent or solids harbored more viral targets. The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and N2 concentrations correlated positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinically confirmed case counts in the sewershed. Together, the results demonstrate that measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in settled solids may be a more sensitive approach than measuring SARS-CoV-2 in influent.},

Many health authorities around the world have implemented wastewater-based epidemiology as a rapid and complementary tool for the COVID-19 surveillance system and more recently for variants of concern emergence tracking. In this study, three SARS-CoV-2 target genes (N1 and N2 gene regions, and E gene) were quantified from wastewater influent samples (n = 250) obtained from the capital city and 7 other cities in various size in central Ohio from July 2020 to January 2021. To determine human-specific fecal strength in wastewater samples more accurately, two human fecal viruses (PMMoV and crAssphage) were quantified to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater. To estimate the trend of new case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 gene levels, different statistical models were built and evaluated. From the longitudinal data, SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater strongly correlated with daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases (average Spearman's r = 0.70, p {\textless} 0.05), with the N2 gene region being the best predictor of the trend of confirmed cases. Moreover, average daily case numbers can help reduce the noise and variation from the clinical data. Among the models tested, the quadratic polynomial model performed best in correlating and predicting COVID-19 cases from the wastewater surveillance data, which can be used to track the effectiveness of vaccination in the later stage of the pandemic. Interestingly, neither of the normalization methods using PMMoV or crAssphage significantly enhanced the correlation with new case numbers, nor improved the estimation models. Viral sequencing showed that shifts in strain-defining variants of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples matched those in clinical isolates from the same time periods. The findings from this study support that wastewater surveillance is effective in COVID-19 trend tracking and provide sentinel warning of variant emergence and transmission within various types of communities.,

In order to improve the understanding of the reaction mechanism of these drugs, in this investigation we present a quantum chemical study of 20 antagonists and 10 agonists. Electron donor acceptor capacity and global hardness are analyzed using Density Functional Theory calculations. Following this theoretical approach, we provide new insights into the intrinsic response of these chemical species. In summary, antagonists generally prove to be better electron acceptors and worse electron donors than dopamine, whereas agonists present an electron donor-acceptor capacity similar to that of dopamine. The chemical hardness is a descriptor that captures the resistance of a chemical compound to change its number of electrons. Within this model, harder molecules are less polarizable and more stable systems. Our results show that the global hardness is similar for dopamine and agonists whilst antagonists present smaller values. Following the Hard and Soft Acid and Bases principle, it is possible to conclude that dopamine and agonists are hard bases while antagonists are soft acids, and this can be related to their activity. From the electronic point of view, we have evolved a new perspective for the classification of agonist and antagonist, which may help to analyze future results of chemical interactions triggered by these drugs.},

In current work, bioinformatics analyses were carried out on Trace amine (TA)-associated receptor 6 (TAAR6) to recognize the potential drugs and compounds against SZ. Comparative modeling and threading-based approaches were utilized for the structure prediction of TAAR6. Fifty-nine predicted structures were evaluated by various model assessment techniques and final model having only eight amino acids in the outlier region and 98.5\% overall quality factor was chosen for further pharmacoinformatics and molecular docking analyses. From an extensive literature review, 11 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs were analyzed by computational techniques and Aripiprazole was found as the most effective drug against SZ by targeting TAAR6. Here, we report five novel molecules which exhibited the highest binding affinity, effective drug properties, and interestingly, observed better results than the approved selected drugs against SZ by targeting TAAR6. The docking analyses revealed that Arg-92, Trp-98, Gln-191, Thr-192, Ala-290, Cys-291, Tyr-293, and Glu-294 residues were observed as critical interacting residues in receptor-ligand interactions. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties, Lipinski rule of five, highest binding affinity coupled with virtual screening (VS), and pharmacophore modeling approach illustrated that aripiprazole (−8.6 kcal/mol) and TAAR6\_0094 (−9.3 kcal/mol) are potential inhibitors for targeting TAAR6. It is suggested that schizophrenic patients have to use Aripiprazole for the medication of SZ by targeting TAAR6 and develop effective therapies by utilizing scrutinized novel compound.},

	abstract = {Although different types of drugs are available for postmenopausal osteoporosis, the limitations of the current therapies including drug resistances and adverse effects require identification of novel anti-osteoporosis agents. Here, we defined that norlichexanthone (NOR), a natural product, is a ligand of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) and revealed its therapeutic potential for postmenopausal osteoporosis. We used mammalian-one hybrid assay to screen for ERα modulators from crude extracts of several plant endophytes. As a result, NOR purified from the extract of endophyte ARL-13 was identified as a selective ERα modulator. NOR directly bound to ERα with an affinity in nanomolar range, revealing that it is a natural ligand of ERα. NOR induced osteoblast formation in MC3T3-E1 precursor cells. Conversely, NOR inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation in both RAW264.7 macrophages and mouse primary monocytes. Mechanistically, NOR inhibited RANKL-induced association of ERα and TRAF6 to prevent ERα-mediated TRAF6 activation via Lys63-linked ubiquitination. Importantly, NOR exhibited potent anti-osteoporosis efficacy in an ovariectomized mouse model. Comparing to estrogen, NOR was of much less capability in stimulating endometrial hyperplasia and promoting mammalian cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, our study identified NOR as a natural and high affinity ligand of ERα with substantial anti-osteoporosis but less estrogenic activity.},

	abstract = {Overactivation of protein kinase in the end stage of Alzheimer’s disease brain has not been established. The purpose of the present study was to explore the possible mechanism for protein kinases in leading to Alzheimer-like tau hyperphosphorylation. We found that incubation of N2a/tau441 with forskolin, a specific activator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), induced an increased phosphorylation level of tau at both PKA and non-PKA sites in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the hyperphosphorylation of tau was positively correlated with the elevation of PKA activity. When the cells were transitorily incubated with forskolin, a temporary activation of PKA with a sustained and almost equally graded tau hyperphosphorylation at some non-PKA sites was observed. In either case, the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) was not changed. It is suggested that only transitory activation of PKA in early stage of Alzheimer disease may result in a sustained tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple sites, implying a new mechanism to Alzheimer-like tau hyperphosphorylation.},

	abstract = {Injury to the brain appears to create a fertile ground for functional and structural plasticity that is, at least partly, responsible for functional recovery. Increases in dendritic arborization, spine density, and synaptogenesis in both peri-injury and intact cortical areas are the potential morphological strategies that enable the brain to reorganize its neuronal circuits. These injury-initiated alterations are time-dependent and frequently proceed in interaction with behavior-related signals. A complex concert of a variety of genes/proteins is required to tightly control these changes. Two broad categories of molecules appear to be involved. First, regulatory molecules or effector molecules with regulatory function, such as immediate early genes/transcription factors, kinase network proteins, growth factors, and neurotransmitter receptors, and second, structural proteins, such as adhesion molecules and compounds of synapses, growth cones, and cytoskeleton. A better understanding of the processes contributing to postinjury plasticity may be an advantage for developing new and more effective therapeutic approaches. This knowledge might also shed light on other forms of brain plasticity, such as those involved in learning processes or ontogeny.},

	abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide pandemic, infecting over 16 million people worldwide with a significant mortality rate. However, there is no current Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that treats coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Damage to T lymphocytes along with the cytokine storm are important factors that lead to exacerbation of clinical cases. Here, we are proposing intravenous oxytocin (OXT) as a candidate for adjunctive therapy for COVID-19. OXT has anti-inflammatory and proimmune adaptive functions. Using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we used the transcriptomic signature for carbetocin, an OXT agonist, and compared it to gene knockdown signatures of inflammatory (such as interleukin IL-1β and IL-6) and proimmune markers (including T cell and macrophage cell markers like CD40 and ARG1). We found that carbetocin’s transcriptomic signature has a pattern of concordance with inflammation and immune marker knockdown signatures that are consistent with reduction of inflammation and promotion and sustaining of immune response. This suggests that carbetocin may have potent effects in modulating inflammation, attenuating T cell inhibition, and enhancing T cell activation. Our results also suggest that carbetocin is more effective at inducing immune cell responses than either lopinavir or hydroxychloroquine, both of which have been explored for the treatment of COVID-19.},

GBM therapy could benefit greatly from patient-specific targeted therapies that maximize treatment efficacy. Here we report a platform termed SynergySeq to identify drug combinations for the treatment of GBM by integrating information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). We identify differentially expressed genes in GBM samples and devise a consensus gene expression signature for each compound using LINCS L1000 transcriptional profiling data. The SynergySeq platform computes disease discordance and drug concordance to identify combinations of FDA-approved drugs that induce a synergistic response in GBM. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that combining disease-specific gene expression signatures with LINCS small molecule perturbagen-response signatures can identify preclinical combinations for GBM, which can potentially be tested in humans.},

Recent approaches to drug repositioning use high-throughput experimental approaches to assess a compound's potential therapeutic qualities. Here, we present a systematic computational approach to predict novel therapeutic indications on the basis of comprehensive testing of molecular signatures in drug-disease pairs. We integrated gene expression measurements from 100 diseases and gene expression measurements on 164 drug compounds, yielding predicted therapeutic potentials for these drugs. We recovered many known drug and disease relationships using computationally derived therapeutic potentials and also predict many new indications for these 164 drugs. We experimentally validated a prediction for the antiulcer drug cimetidine as a candidate therapeutic in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, and demonstrate its efficacy both in vitro and in vivo using mouse xenograft models. This computational method provides a systematic approach for repositioning established drugs to treat a wide range of human diseases.},

	abstract = {Since its founding, in 1995, Amazon.com's bold moves have often left observers scratching their heads, if not predicting the company's demise. Why open up an effective proprietary retail platform to competition from third-party sellers? Why make tools that Amazon developed for its own use available to other website developers? (Why, for that matter, post negative reviews of your products?) Two HBR editors interviewed Bezos, the founder and CEO, to learn what's different about strategy formulation at Amazon. They came away with the sense that the company's strategy and culture are rooted in a sturdy entrepreneurial optimism and rest on the single question of what's better for the customer. Bezos describes himself as "congenitally customer focused." He knows that the buyers in Amazon's consumer-facing business want selection, low prices, and fast delivery - and he's confident that won't change. "I can't imagine," he says, "that ten years from now [our customers] are going to say, 'I love Amazon, but if only they could deliver my products a little more slowly.'" Competitor-focused companies risk complacency when they become industry leaders, he maintains, but customer-focused companies must always keep improving. "Years from now," Bezos says, "when people look back at Amazon, I want them to say that we uplifted customer-centricity across the entire business world." If Amazon has made strategic mistakes, he says, they have been errors of omission. So when something seems like an opportunity, Bezos asks the question, "Why not?" which leads to maximizing the number of experiments companywide: "People say, 'We're going to do this. We're going to figure out a way.'" That's the institutional yes.},

Since Akt signaling participates in cytoprotection, synapse plasticity, axon extension, and neurotransmission in the nervous system, alteration in Akt signaling might be a potential cause of schizophrenia. In this study, we performed multiplex fluorescent bead based immunoassays for members of the Akt signaling pathway in postmortem brains of controls and patients with schizophrenia. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR) was significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with schizophrenia, and the expression level of VEGFR2 was inversely correlated with the positive symptom subscale of the Diagnostic Instrument for Brain Studies (DIBS) in patients with schizophrenia. There was also an increase in phosphorylated Akt1 in the PFC in the patients, though the ratio of phospho/total Akt1 is not significantly different. In the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) there was no significant difference in expression and phosphorylation levels of Akt signaling proteins. Genetic analysis revealed a significant correlation of a SNP of KDR (rs7692791) with ERK1/2 and Akt1 phospho/total rates. Since VEGFR2 participates in angiogenesis and neurotrophic activation, either or both functions might be responsible for onset of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Both connectivity and biophysical processes determine the functionality of neuronal networks. We, therefore, develop a real-time framework, called Neural Interactome1, to simultaneously visualize and interact with the structure and dynamics of such networks. Neural Interactome is a cross-platform framework, which combines graph visualization with the simulation of neural dynamics, or experimentally recorded multi neural time series, to allow application of stimuli to neurons to examine network responses. In addition, Neural Interactome supports structural changes, such as disconnection of neurons from the network (ablation feature), as typically done in experiments. Neural dynamics can be explored on a single neuron level (using a zoom feature), back in time (using a review feature) and recorded (using presets feature). We implement the framework using a model of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode, a model organism for which full connectome and neural dynamics have been resolved. We show that Neural Interactome assists in studying neural response patterns associated with locomotion and other stimuli. In particular, we demonstrate how stimulation and ablation help in identifying neurons that shape particular dynamics. We examine scenarios that were experimentally studied, such as touch response circuit, and explore new scenarios that did not undergo elaborate experimental studies. The development of the Neural Interactome was guided by generic concepts to be applicable to neuronal networks with different neural connectivity and dynamics. Author Summary Emerging neuroimaging techniques and novel optical interfaces which record and control neural dynamics enable detailed computational connectivity and dynamics models for neurobiological systems. An open question stemming from these advances is how to validate, simulate and apply these models to predict network functionality. Supervised empirical exploration to identify functional stimulations is an elaborate process, and direct computational approach of sequential stimulation is also formidable since produces large amounts of data without clarity on how it can be used to steer toward meaningful functionalities. We therefore develop a platform to inspect network dynamics in real time while preserving structural connectivity properties, displaying the dynamics on a graph, with possibilities to identify functional sub circuits and review the simulated dynamics. The platform allows for real time interactions with the network such as variation of stimuli and performing connectivity changes as neural ablation. We apply the platform to Caenorhabditis elegans nematode nervous system model. We revisit experimentally known scenarios of stimulations and show how our platform helps to detect associated neural dynamic patterns within seconds through few interactions. In addition, we show how the platform could provide novel hypotheses for scenarios that were not yet explored empirically. By implementing the platform with flexibility for changes in connectivity and dynamic models, this work sets forth a generic methodology applicable to various neurobiological systems.},

This leads to an imbalance in research attention where some genes are highly investigated while others are ignored. Geneshot is a search engine developed to illuminate this gap and to promote attention to the under-studied genome. Through a simple web interface, Geneshot enables researchers to enter arbitrary search terms, to receive ranked lists of genes relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked gene lists contain genes that were previously published in association with the search terms, as well as genes predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from multiple sources. The search results are presented with interactive visualizations. To predict gene function, Geneshot utilizes gene-gene similarity matrices from processed RNA-seq data, or from gene-gene co-occurrence data obtained from multiple sources. In addition, Geneshot can be used to analyze the novelty of gene sets and augment gene sets with additional relevant genes. The Geneshot web-server and API are freely and openly available from https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/geneshot.},

	abstract = {Proteins and their functional interactions form the backbone of the cellular machinery. Their connectivity network needs to be considered for the full understanding of biological phenomena, but the available information on protein-protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of annotation granularity and reliability. The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein-protein interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself.

We found that human astrocytes have abilities similar to those of murine astrocytes in promoting neuronal survival, inducing functional synapse formation, and engulfing synaptosomes. In contrast to existing observations in mice, we found that mature human astrocytes respond robustly to glutamate. Next, we performed RNA sequencing of healthy human astrocytes along with astrocytes from epileptic and tumor foci and compared these to human neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (available at http://www.brainrnaseq.org). With these profiles, we identified novel human-specific astrocyte genes and discovered a transcriptome-wide transformation between astrocyte precursor cells and mature post-mitotic astrocytes.

	abstract = {Previous investigations have combined transcriptional and genetic analyses in human cell lines, but few have applied these techniques to human neural tissue. To gain a global molecular perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical development, function and ageing, we explore the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in human prefrontal cortex in an extensive series of post-mortem brains from fetal development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association between the total extent of genetic differences between subjects and the global similarity of their transcriptional profiles. Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular architecture in the prefrontal cortex, despite millions of genetic differences across individuals and races. To enable further discovery, this entire data set is freely available (from Gene Expression Omnibus: accession GSE30272; and dbGaP: accession phs000417.v1.p1) and can also be interrogated via a biologist-friendly stand-alone application (http://www.libd.org/braincloud). © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To understand mechanisms underlying AF10 fusion-mediated leukemogenesis, we generated inducible mouse models of AML driven by the most common AF10 fusion proteins, PICALM/CALM-AF10 and KMT2A/MLL-AF10, and performed comprehensive characterization of the disease using transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and functional genomic approaches. Our studies provide a detailed map of gene networks and protein interactors associated with key AF10 fusions involved in leukemia. Specifically, we report that AF10 fusions activate a cascade of JAK/STAT-mediated inflammatory signaling through direct recruitment of JAK1 kinase. Inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling by genetic Jak1 deletion or through pharmacological JAK/STAT inhibition elicited potent anti-oncogenic effects in mouse and human models of AF10 fusion AML.

	abstract = {Xanthomonas is a notorious plant pathogen causing serious diseases in hundreds of plant hosts. Xanthomonas species are equipped with an array of signal transduction systems that regulate gene expression to survive in various harsh environments and successfully infect hosts. Although certain pathogenicity-associated regulators have been functionally characterized, signal transduction systems always function as a regulatory network which remains to be elucidated in Xanthomonas This study used a systematic approach to characterize all identified pathogenicity-associated regulators in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), including a transcriptional regulator with unknown function, and their interactive regulatory network. RNA sequencing was used in elucidating the patterns of the 10 pathogenicity-associated regulators identified. Results revealed that each pathogenicity-associated regulator has cross talk with others and all these regulators function as a regulatory network, with VemR and PXO\_RS20790 being the master pathogenicity-associated regulators and HrpX being the final executant. Moreover, regulome analysis showed that numerous genes other than genes in pathogenicity islands are finely regulated within the regulatory network. Given that most of the pathogenicity-associated regulators are conserved in Xanthomonadales, our findings suggest a global network of gene regulation in this evolutionarily conserved pathogen. In conclusion, our study provides essential basic information about the regulatory network in Xoo, suggesting that this complicated regulatory network is one of the reasons for the robustness and fitness of Xanthomonas spp.IMPORTANCE The host plant infection process of pathogenic bacteria is a coordinating cellular behavior, which requires dynamic regulation at several levels in response to variations in host plants or fluctuations in the external environment. As one of the most important genera of plant-pathogenic bacteria, Xanthomonas has been studied as a model. Although certain pathogenicity-associated regulators have been functionally characterized, interactions among them remain to be elucidated. This study systematically characterized pathogenicity-associated regulators in Xoo and revealed that cross talk exists among pathogenicity-associated regulators and function as a regulatory network in which a hierarchy exists among the regulators. Our study elucidated the landscape of the pathogenicity-associated regulatory network in Xanthomonas, promoting understanding of the infection process of pathogenic bacteria.},

We recently showed that the detection of motor activity during a median nerve stimulation from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals could be used to alert the medical staff that a patient is waking up and trying to move under general anesthesia [1], [2]. In this work, we measure the accuracy and false positive rate in detecting motor imagery of several deep learning models (EEGNet, deep convolutional network and shallow convolutional network) directly trained on filtered EEG data. We compare them with efficient non-deep approaches, namely, a linear discriminant analysis based on common spatial patterns, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean algorithm applied to covariance matrices, a logistic regression based on a tangent space projection of covariance matrices (TS+LR). The EEGNet improves significantly the classification performance comparing to other classifiers (p- value {\textless} 0.01); moreover it outperforms the best non-deep classifier (TS+LR) for 7.2\% of accuracy. This approach promises to improve intraoperative awareness detection during general anesthesia.},

Most well-known convolutional neural networks implementations require a significant amount of memory to store weights in the process of learning and working. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture in which the neural network is divided into hardware and software parts to increase performance and reduce the cost of implementation resources. We also propose to use the residue number system (RNS) in the hardware part to implement the convolutional layer of the neural network. Software simulations using Matlab 2018b showed that convolutional neural network with a minimum number of layers can be quickly and successfully trained. The hardware implementation of the convolution layer shows that the use of RNS allows to reduce the hardware costs on 7.86\%–37.78\% compared to the two's complement implementation. The use of the proposed heterogeneous implementation reduces the average time of image recognition by 41.17\%.},

Since all the transactions are recorded in great detail, investors can analyze all the generated data and detect repeated patterns of the price movements. Being able to detect them in advance, allows them to take profitable positions or avoid anomalous events in the financial markets. In this work we proposed a deep learning methodology, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that predicts the price movements of stocks, using as input large-scale, high-frequency time-series derived from the order book of financial exchanges. The dataset that we use contains more than 4 million limit order events and our comparison with other methods, like Multilayer Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, shows that CNNs are better suited for this kind of task.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

	abstract = {Background: Inferring gene regulatory networks from large-scale expression data is an important problem that received much attention in recent years. These networks have the potential to gain insights into causal molecular interactions of biological processes. Hence, from a methodological point of view, reliable estimation methods based on observational data are needed to approach this problem practically.Results: In this paper, we introduce a novel gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) algorithm, called C3NET. We compare C3NET with four well known methods, ARACNE, CLR, MRNET and RN, conducting in-depth numerical ensemble simulations and demonstrate also for biological expression data from E. coli that C3NET performs consistently better than the best known GRNI methods in the literature. In addition, it has also a low computational complexity. Since C3NET is based on estimates of mutual information values in conjunction with a maximization step, our numerical investigations demonstrate that our inference algorithm exploits causal structural information in the data efficiently.Conclusions: For systems biology to succeed in the long run, it is of crucial importance to establish methods that extract large-scale gene networks from high-throughput data that reflect the underlying causal interactions among genes or gene products. Our method can contribute to this endeavor by demonstrating that an inference algorithm with a neat design permits not only a more intuitive and possibly biological interpretation of its working mechanism but can also result in superior results. © 2010 Altay and Emmert-Streib; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Microarray technology has become a standard molecular biology tool. Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data. © Published by Oxford University Press 2007.},

	abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that psychological stress impairs wound healing in humans and rodents. However, most research effort into influences on wound healing has focused on factors that compromise, rather than promote, healing. In the present study, we determined if positive social interaction, which influences hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in social rodents, promotes wound healing. Siberian hamsters received a cutaneous wound and then were exposed to immobilization stress. Stress increased cortisol concentrations and impaired wound healing in isolated, but not socially housed, hamsters. Removal of endogenous cortisol via adrenalectomy eliminated the effects of stress on wound healing in isolated hamsters. Treatment of isolated hamsters with oxytocin (OT), a hormone released during social contact and associated with social bonding, also blocked stress-induced increases in cortisol concentrations and facilitated wound healing. In contrast, treating socially housed hamsters with an OT antagonist delayed wound healing. Taken together, these data suggest that social interactions buffer against stress and promote wound healing through a mechanism that involves OT-induced suppression of the HPA axis. The data imply that social isolation impairs wound healing, whereas OT treatment may ameliorate some effects of social isolation on health. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Different methods have been proposed for analyzing differentially expressed (DE) genes in microarray data. Methods based on statistical tests that incorporate expression level variability are used more commonly than those based on fold change (FC). However, FC based results are more reproducible and biologically relevant.Results: We propose a new method based on fold change rank ordering statistics (FCROS). We exploit the variation in calculated FC levels using combinatorial pairs of biological conditions in the datasets. A statistic is associated with the ranks of the FC values for each gene, and the resulting probability is used to identify the DE genes within an error level. The FCROS method is deterministic, requires a low computational runtime and also solves the problem of multiple tests which usually arises with microarray datasets.Conclusion: We compared the performance of FCROS with those of other methods using synthetic and real microarray datasets. We found that FCROS is well suited for DE gene identification from noisy datasets when compared with existing FC based methods. © 2014 Dembélé and Kastner; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Many researchers are concerned with the comparability and reliability of microarray gene expression data. Recent completion of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project provides a unique opportunity to assess reproducibility across multiple sites and the comparability across multiple platforms. The MAQC analysis presented for the conclusion of inter- and intra-platform comparability/reproducibility of microarray gene expression measurements is inadequate. We evaluate the reproducibility/comparability of the MAQC data for 12901 common genes in four titration samples generated from five high-density one-color microarray platforms and the TaqMan technology. We discuss some of the problems with the use of correlation coefficient as metric to evaluate the inter- and intra-platform reproducibility and the percent of overlapping genes (POG) as a measure for evaluation of a gene selection procedure by MAQC. Results: A total of 293 arrays were used in the intra- and inter-platform analysis. A hierarchical cluster analysis shows distinct differences in the measured intensities among the five platforms. A number of genes show a small fold-change in one platform and a large fold-change in another platform, even though the correlations between platforms are high. An analysis of variance shows thirty percent of gene expressions of the samples show inconsistent patterns across the five platforms. We illustrated that POG does not reflect the accuracy of a selected gene list. A non-overlapping gene can be truly differentially expressed with a stringent cut, and an overlapping gene can be non-differentially expressed with non-stringent cutoff. In addition, POG is an unusable selection criterion. POG can increase or decrease irregularly as cutoff changes; there is no criterion to determine a cutoff so that POG is optimized. Conclusion: Using various statistical methods we demonstrate that there are differences in the intensities measured by different platforms and different sites within platform. Within each platform, the patterns of expression are generally consistent, but there is site-by-site variability. Evaluation of data analysis methods for use in regulatory decision should take no treatment effect into consideration, when there is no treatment effect, "a fold-change cutoff with a non-stringent p-value cutoff" could result in 100\% false positive error selection. © 2007 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objective: During and after menopause, the symptoms of vaginal atrophy cause great discomfort and necessitate effective treatment options. Currently, vaginally applied oxytocin is being investigated as a treatment for the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. To clarify the mechanisms behind oxytocins effects on vaginal atrophy, the present study investigated the effects of oxytocin on cell proliferation in the cells of the Vk2E6E7 line, a non-tumour vaginal cell line. The study also compared the effects of oxytocin with those of estradiol (E2). Study design: The effects of both oxytocin and E2 on the proliferation of Vk2E6E7 cells were investigated using Cell Proliferation ELISA BrdU Colorimetric Assay. The expression of both oxytocin and oxytocin receptor was studied in Vk2E6E7 cells using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining. Main outcome measures: Cell proliferation and gene expression. Results: Oxytocin increased cell proliferation both time dependently and dose dependently. This differed from the effect pattern observed in cells treated with E2. In addition, in oxytocin-treated cells, the oxytocin receptor was found to be co-localized with caveolin-1, indicating pro-proliferative signalling within the cell. Conclusions: Oxytocin stimulates cell proliferation and the co-localization of oxytocin receptor with caveolin-1 in oxytocin-treated cells, supporting the role of oxytocin signalling in cell proliferation. In addition, these findings suggest that increased cell proliferation is one mechanism by which local vaginal oxytocin treatment increases vaginal thickness and relieves vaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy.},

	abstract = {Oxytocin is a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus and it is best known for its role in labour and lactation. This double-blind, randomized study was performed at Huddinge Hospital of Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm in order to test the effectiveness of topical oxytocin gel in women with postmenopausal vaginal atrophy. Twenty postmenopausal women (at least two years after menopause) with symptoms of vaginal atrophy such as vaginal dryness, pain, itching, discomfort and bleeding during intercourse were enrolled in the study when visual inspection of the vagina had confirmed that their mucosa was atrophic. The participants were randomized to intravaginal treatment with either oxytocin or placebo gel for seven days. Before and after treatment, a gynaecological examination and a visual and colposcopic inspection of the vagina were performed, biopsies from the vaginal mucosa were taken and blood samples were collected for analysis of circulating levels of estradiol and oxytocin. Prior to treatment, visual and colposcopic inspection showed that all of the 20 participants had an atrophic vaginal mucosa. After treatment with the oxytocin gel, the examination showed that the vaginal epithelium of seven of the 10 participants in the oxytocin group had become healthier and normalized. No change in these parameters was observed among the 10 participants in the placebo group. This difference between the oxytocin and placebo groups was significant (P= 0.003). Seven participants in the active group and four in the placebo group reported relief of symptoms of vaginal atrophy after seven days of applying the gel. The effect of oxytocin to normalize the morphological appearance of the vaginal mucosa was almost significant when compared with the placebo group (P= 0.07). There was no significant difference between the circulating levels of estradiol and oxytocin in both the oxytocin and placebo groups before and after treatment. None of the participants reported any side-effects. Topical treatment with oxytocin appears to improve vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A limitation of this pilot study is that it was based on a small study population hence the results should be regarded with caution. Larger studies are in progress to establish the possibility of using oxytocin as a clinical treatment for vaginal atrophy. © 2011, The British Menopause Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The treatment of CNS disorders, and in particular psychiatric illnesses, lacks disease-altering therapeutics for many conditions. This is likely due to regulatory challenges involving the high cost and slow-pace of drug development for CNS disorders as well as due to limited understanding of disease causality. Repurposing drugs for new indications have lower cost and shorter development timeline compared to that of de novo drug development. Historically, empirical drug-repurposing is a standard practice in psychiatry; however, recent advances in characterizing molecules with their structural and transcriptomic signatures along with ensemble of data analysis approaches, provides informed and cost-effective repurposing strategies that ameliorate the regulatory challenges. In addition, the potential to incorporate ontological approaches along with signature-based repurposing techniques addresses the various knowledge-based challenges associated with CNS drug development. In this review we primarily discuss signature-based in silico approaches to drug repurposing, and its integration with data science platforms for evidence-based drug repurposing. We contrast various in silico and empirical approaches and discuss possible avenues to improve the clinical relevance. These concepts provide a promising new translational avenue for developing new therapies for difficult to treat disorders, and offer the possibility of connecting drug discovery platforms and big data analytics with personalized disease signatures.

	abstract = {CNS disorders, and in particular psychiatric illnesses, lack definitive disease-altering therapeutics. The limited understanding of the mechanisms driving these illnesses with the slow pace and high cost of drug development exacerbates this issue. For these reasons, drug repurposing – both a less expensive and time-efficient practice compared to de novo drug development – has been a promising strategy to overcome the paucity of treatments available for these debilitating disorders. While empirical drug-repurposing has been a routine practice in clinical psychiatry, innovative, informed, and cost-effective repurposing efforts using big data (“omics”) have been designed to characterize drugs by structural and transcriptomic signatures. These strategies, in conjunction with ontological integration, provide an important opportunity to address knowledge-based challenges associated with drug development for CNS disorders. In this review, we discuss various signature-based in silico approaches to drug repurposing, its integration with multiple omics platforms, and how this data can be used for clinically relevant, evidence-based drug repurposing. These tools provide an exciting translational avenue to merge omics-based drug discovery platforms with patient-specific disease signatures, ultimately facilitating the identification of new therapies for numerous psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Background: Annotations of the phylogenetic tree of the human kinome is an intuitive way to visualize compound profiling data, structural features of kinases or functional relationships within this important class of proteins. The increasing volume and complexity of kinase-related data underlines the need for a tool that enables complex queries pertaining to kinase disease involvement and potential therapeutic uses of kinase inhibitors. Results: Here, we present KinMap, a user-friendly online tool that facilitates the interactive navigation through kinase knowledge by linking biochemical, structural, and disease association data to the human kinome tree. To this end, preprocessed data from freely-available sources, such as ChEMBL, the Protein Data Bank, and the Center for Therapeutic Target Validation platform are integrated into KinMap and can easily be complemented by proprietary data. The value of KinMap will be exemplarily demonstrated for uncovering new therapeutic indications of known kinase inhibitors and for prioritizing kinases for drug development efforts. Conclusion: KinMap represents a new generation of kinome tree viewers which facilitates interactive exploration of the human kinome. KinMap enables generation of high-quality annotated images of the human kinome tree as well as exchange of kinome-related data in scientific communications. Furthermore, KinMap supports multiple input and output formats and recognizes alternative kinase names and links them to a unified naming scheme, which makes it a useful tool across different disciplines and applications.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1\%, 82.7\% and 64.7\%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was {\textless}40\% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0\% (Ab), 94.3\% (IgM) and 79.8\% (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7\% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5\% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p{\textless}0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.},

	abstract = {An outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in Wuhan and spread globally. Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of "relapse" or "reinfection". The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.},

	abstract = {Objective: To determine the feasibility and potential usefulness of mathematical models in evaluating immunomodulatory strategies in clinical trials of severe sepsis. Design: Mathematical modeling of immunomodulation in simulated patients. Setting: Computer laboratory. Measurements anu Main Results: We introduce and evaluate the concept of conducting a randomized clinical trial in silico based on simulated patients generated from a mechanistic mathematical model of bacterial infection, the acute inflammatory response, global tissue dysfunction, and a therapeutic intervention. Trial populations are constructed to reflect heterogeneity in bacterial load and virulence as well as propensity to mount and modulate an inflammatory response. We constructed a cohort of 1,080 trial patients submitted to therapy with one of three different doses of a neutralizing antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) for 6, 24, or 48 hrs. We present cytokine profiles over time and expected outcome for each cohort. We identify subgroups with high propensity for being helped or harmed by the proposed intervention and identify early serum markers for each of those subgroups. The mathematical simulation confirms the inability of simple markers to predict outcome of sepsis. The simulation clearly separates cases with favorable and unfavorable outcome on the basis of global tissue dysfunction. Control survival was 62.9\% at 1 wk. Depending on dose and duration of treatment, survival ranged from 57.1\% to 80.8\%. Higher doses of anti-TNF, although effective, also result in considerable harm to patients. A statistical analysis based on a simulated cohort identified markers of favorable or adverse response to anti-TNF treatment. Conclusions: A mathematical simulation of anti-TNF therapy identified clear windows of opportunity for this Intervention as well as populations that can be harmed by anti-TNF therapy. The construction of an in silica clinical trial could provide profound insight into the design of clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies, ranging from optimal patient selection to individualized dosage and duration of proposed therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: The development of a multiscale model of the human musculoskeletal system able to accurately predict the risk of bone fracture is still a grand challenge. The aim of this paper is to present the Living Human Project, to describe the final system and to review the achievements obtained so far. The Living Human musculoskeletal supermodel is conceived as the interconnection of five interdependent sub-models: the continuum, the boundary condition, the constitutive equation, the remodelling history and the failure criterion sub-models. Methods: Methods are available to develop accurate subject-specific finite element models of bones that can incorporate the subject's tissue-density distribution and empirically derived constitutive laws. Anatomo-functional musculoskeletal models can be registered with gait analysis data to predict muscle and joint forces acting on the patient's skeleton during gait. These are the boundary conditions for the continuum models that showed an average error of 12\% in the prediction of the failure load. Still, the entire supermodel is defined as a collection of procedural macros to predict the risk of fracture and should be improved. Findings: Even with these limitations, the organ-level model already found some clinically relevant applications, especially in the analysis of joint prostheses. Also, the body-organ level multiscale model finds some clinical applications in paediatric skeletal oncology. The tissue- and the cell-level models are not yet fully validated. Thus, they cannot be safely used in clinical applications. Interpretation: The continuum sub-model is the most mature model available. More powerful methods are needed for the generation of anatomo-functional musculoskeletal models. Muscle force prediction should be improved, investigating new probabilistic approaches to identify the neuro-motor strategy. The changes of the tissue properties in the various regions of the skeleton and predictive remodelling models should be included. An adequate information technology infrastructure should be developed to support collaborative work and integration of different sub-models. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Wound healing capability is inextricably linked with diverse aspects of physical fitness ranging from recovery after minor injuries and surgery to diabetes and some types of cancer. Impact of the microbiome upon the mammalian wound healing process is poorly understood. We discover that supplementing the gut microbiome with lactic acid microbes in drinking water accelerates the wound-healing process to occur in half the time required for matched control animals. Further, we find that Lactobacillus reuteri enhances wound-healing properties through up-regulation of the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin, a factor integral in social bonding and reproduction, by a vagus nerve-mediated pathway. Bacteria-triggered oxytocin serves to activate host CD4+Foxp3+CD25+ immune T regulatory cells conveying transplantable wound healing capacity to naive Rag2-deficient animals. This study determined oxytocin to be a novel component of a multi-directional gut microbe-brain-immune axis, with wound-healing capability as a previously unrecognized output of this axis. We also provide experimental evidence to support long-standing medical traditions associating diet, social practices, and the immune system with efficient recovery after injury, sustained good health, and longevity. © 2013 Poutahidis et al.},

Within Europe, this has its focus in the virtual physiological human (VPH), which is an evolving entity that has emerged from the EuroPhysiome initiative and the strategy for the EuroPhysiome (STEP) consortium. The VPH is intended to be a solution to common infrastructure needs for physiome projects across the globe, providing a unifying architecture that facilitates integration and prediction, ultimately creating a framework capable of describing Homo sapiens in silico. The routine reliance of the biomedical industry, biomedical research and clinical practice on information technology (IT) highlights the importance of a tailor-made and robust IT infrastructure, but numerous challenges need to be addressed if the VPH is to become a mature technological reality. Appropriate investment will reap considerable rewards, since it is anticipated that the VPH will influence all sectors of society, with implications predominantly for improved healthcare, improved competitiveness in industry and greater understanding of (patho)physiological processes.

Generally, TLR9 is known to recognize bacterial or viral DNA but not viral RNA and initiate an immune response. Herein, we demonstrate that infection with dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus, activates TLR9 in human dendritic cells (DCs). DENV infection induces release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol and activates TLR9 signaling pathways, leading to production of interferons (IFNs). The DENV-induced mtDNA release involves reactive oxygen species generation and inflammasome activation. DENV infection disrupts the association between transcription factor A mitochondria (TFAM) and mtDNA and activates the mitochondrial permeability transition pores. The side-by-side comparison of TLR9 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) knockdown reveals that both cGAS and TLR9 comparably contribute to DENV-induced immune activation. The significance of TLR9 in DENV-induced immune response is also confirmed in examination with the bone marrow-derived DCs prepared from Tlr9-knockout mice. Our study unravels a previously unrecognized phenomenon in which infection with an RNA virus, DENV, activates TLR9 signaling by inducing mtDNA release in human DCs.},

Microorganisms of different species isolated by conventional methods from patients with purulent soft tissue infections were used in experiments. Ciprofloxacin manufactured by "Dr. Reddys" (India) and oxytocin manufactured by "Gedeon Richter" (Hungary) were used. For in vitro experiments one-half of minimal inhibitory concentrations of drugs were used. Oxytocin-placebo ("Gedeon Richter", Hungary) was used for control tests. Formation of biofilms was assessed using method proposed by G. O'Toole (2000). For in vivo experiments septic wounds in 1st phase of wound process were modeled according to method proposed by E.M. Danilova (1992). Wounds were infected with Staphylococcus aureus strain 104, which has strong ability to form biofilms. Efficacy of treatment was assessed on signs of inflammatory process and microscopy of touch smears for detection of bacterial biofilms. In experiments in vivo addition of oxytocin to nutrient medium resulted in suppression of biofilm formation by studied microorganisms. Obtained data were confirmed by in vivo experiments which demonstrated higher efficacy of local application of ciprofloxacin and oxytocin combination for treatment of septic wounds compared to separate use of ciprofloxacin or oxytocin. Studies performed in vitro and in vivo showed efficacy of oxytocin and ciprofloxacin combination, which is determined not only by enhancement of antimicrobial effect of the drug against pathogen but also by suppression of biofilm formation in the wound during infection.},

In order to counteract the innate host immune system viruses evolved mechanisms that block recognition and signaling through pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs and RNA helicases.

One such pair, CCR6 and its chemokine ligand CCL20, has been receiving interest for its potential role in the coordination and regulation of humoral immune responses and in particular, memory responses, at the cellular level. B cells up-regulate CCR6 after activation in secondary lymphoid organs; however, its function is still unclear. In an important insight, the CCR6-CCL20 chemokine axis has been implicated in the regulation of effective humoral responses – disruption of this pair led to an increased number of ineffective T-B cell conjugates and poorer quality antibodies. Interestingly, follicular helper T cells and their precursors also up-regulate CCR6; though, again, the precise purpose of this is yet to be discovered. The chemokine axis in relation to secondary lymphoid organ (SLO) structures will be briefly reviewed as well. With the implication of CCR6 and CCL20 in the pathogenesis of autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, understanding the intricacies of this chemokine pair would be conducive to the development of appropriate, targeted therapeutic strategies.},

While initially described as a regulator of complement activity, it later became a 'magnet for pathogens', binding to several viruses and bacteria. More recently, an alternative role for such complement molecules has emerged: they do regulate T-cell immunity, affecting T-cell proliferation and differentiation. In particular, CD46 stimulation induces Tr1 cells, regulatory T cells characterized by massive production of interleukin-10 (IL-10), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. Hence, CD46 is likely to control inflammation. Indeed, data from CD46 transgenic mice highlight a role for CD46 in inflammation, with antagonist roles depending on the cytoplasmic tail being expressed. Furthermore, recent data have shown that CD46 is defective in multiple sclerosis, IL-10 production being severely impaired in these patients. This lack of IL-10 production probably participates in the inflammation observed in patients with multiple sclerosis. This review will summarize the data on CD46 and T cells, and how CD46 is likely involved in multiple sclerosis. © 2008 The Authors.},

The outcome of TLR signaling in B cells is largely context-dependent, which partly explains discrepancies among in vitro and in vivo studies, or studies using different immunogens. We focus on recent findings on how B-cell-intrinsic TLR signaling regulates antibody responses, including germinal center formation and autoantibody production in autoimmune disease models. In addition, TLR signaling also acts on the precursors of B cells, which could influence the immune response of animals by shaping the composition of the immune system.

The objective of this study was to test the utility of machine learning of big data in gaining insight into the treatment of hypertension. We applied machine learning techniques such as decision trees and neural networks, to identify determinants that contribute to the success of hypertension drug treatment on a large set of patients. We also identified concomitant drugs not considered to have antihypertensive activity, which may contribute to lowering blood pressure (BP) control. Higher initial BP predicts lower success rates. Among the medication options and their combinations, treatment with beta blockers appears to be more commonly effective, which is not reflected in contemporary guidelines. Among numerous concomitant drugs taken by hypertensive patients, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and HMG CO-A reductase inhibitors (statins) significantly improved the success rate of hypertension. In conclusions, machine learning of big data is a novel method to identify effective antihypertensive therapy and for repurposing medications already on the market for new indications. Our results related to beta blockers, stemming from machine learning of a large and diverse set of big data, in contrast to the much narrower criteria for randomized clinic trials (RCTs), should be corroborated and affirmed by other methods, as they hold potential promise for an old class of drugs which may be presently underutilized. These previously unrecognized effects of PPIs and statins have been very recently identified as effective in lowering BP in preliminary clinical observations, lending credibility to our big data results.},

A major unresolved issue is how these different populations of Tregs exert their suppressive function in vivo. We have developed novel systems in which the function of Tregs can be evaluated in vivo in normal mice. Our studies demonstrate that one prominent mechanism of action of polyclonal tTregs is to inhibit T-effector cell trafficking to the target organ, while antigen-specific iTregs primarily prevent T-cell priming by acting on antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays an important role in the suppressive function of antigen-specific iTregs by controlling the expression of MARCH1 and CD83 on the DC. Activated tTregs may mediate infectious tolerance by delivery of cell surface-expressed TGFβ to naive responder T cells to generate pTregs. Manipulation of Treg function will require the ability to differentiate tTregs from pTregs and iTregs.

This is the aim of computational pharmacology, which uses in silico techniques to better understand and predict how drugs affect biological systems, which can in turn improve clinical use, avoid unwanted side effects, and guide selection and development of better treatments. One exciting application of computational pharmacology is drug repurposing-finding new uses for existing drugs. Already yielding many promising candidates, this strategy has the potential to improve the efficiency of the drug development process and reach patient populations with previously unmet needs such as those with rare diseases. While current techniques in computational pharmacology and drug repurposing often focus on just a single data modality such as gene expression or drug-target interactions, we argue that methods such as matrix factorization that can integrate data within and across diverse data types have the potential to improve predictive performance and provide a fuller picture of a drug's pharmacological action.},

Chemogenomics is a direct descendent of the typical drug discovery process that involves the systematic screening of chemical compounds against drug targets in high-throughput screening (HTS) efforts, for the identification of lead compounds. However, different to the one-drug-one-target paradigm, chemogenomics attempts to identify all potential ligands for all possible targets and diseases. In this review, we summarize current methodological development efforts in drug repositioning that use state-of-the-art computational ligand- and structure-based chemogenomics approaches.

	abstract = {The recent REACH Policy of the European Union has led to scientists and regulators to focus their attention on establishing general validation principles for QSAR models in the context of chemical regulation (previously known as the Setubal, nowadays, the OECD principles). This paper gives a brief analysis of some principles: unambiguous algorithm, Applicability Domain (AD), and statistical validation. Some concerns related to QSAR algorithm reproducibility and an example of a fast check of the applicability domain for MLR models are presented. Common myths and misconceptions related to popular techniques for verifying internal predictivity, particularly for MLR models (for instance cross-validation, bootstrap), are commented on and compared with commonly used statistical techniques for external validation. The differences in the two validating approaches are highlighted, and evidence is presented that only models that have been validated externally, after their internal validation, can be considered reliable and applicable for both external prediction and regulatory purposes.

We describe here a novel assembly-based approach to variant calling, the GATK HaplotypeCaller (HC) and Reference Confidence Model (RCM), that determines genotype likelihoods independently per-sample but performs joint calling across all samples within a project simultaneously. We show by calling over 90,000 samples from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) that, in contrast to other algorithms, the HC-RCM scales efficiently to very large sample sizes without loss in accuracy; and that the accuracy of indel variant calling is superior in comparison to other algorithms. More importantly, the HC-RCM produces a fully squared-off matrix of genotypes across all samples at every genomic position being investigated. The HCRCM is a novel, scalable, assembly-based algorithm with abundant applications for population genetics and clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Synthetic cannabinoids (SC) use has had a dramatic increase in recent years, but data regarding their adverse effects on mental health is limited. In this study, we compared clinical presentations of SC users with cannabis users in a psychiatric inpatient setting.Methods: Digital charts of all patients who were admitted to a dual diagnosis psychiatric unit in one year were reviewed. Patients who had any current substance use disorder were categorized in four groups: (1) SC use and cannabis use (SC+MJ+), (2) SC use without cannabis use (SC+MJ-), (3) cannabis use without SC use (SC-MJ+), and (4) No SC or cannabis use (SC-MJ-).Results: A total of 594 charts were included. SC+MJ- patients had significantly more psychotic symptoms (OR: 4.44, 95\% CI: 1.98–9.94), followed by SC+MJ+ (OR: 3.61, 95\% CI: 1.87–6.97) and SC-MJ+ (OR: 1.87, 95\%CI: 1.33–2.64) patients. The SC+MJ- group also had more agitation and aggression was most prominent in SC+MJ+ subjects. Multivariate analyses showed that the psychiatric associations of SC and cannabis use remained significant even after controlling for potential confounds such as other substance use.Conclusions: The prominent psychiatric features of SC users as compared to cannabis users in an inpatient setting are psychotic presentations and agitation, which have important treatment implications.},

These “prosocial” effects appear to motivate the recreational use of MDMA and may also form the basis of its potential as an adjunct to psychotherapy. However, the extent to which MDMA differs from prototypic stimulant drugs, such as dextroamphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate, in either its behavioral effects or mechanisms of action, is not fully known. The purpose of this review is to evaluate human laboratory findings of the social effects of MDMA compared to other stimulants, ranging from simple subjective ratings of sociability to more complex elements of social processing and behavior. We also review the neurochemical mechanisms by which these drugs may impact sociability. Together, the findings reviewed here lay the groundwork for better understanding the socially enhancing effects of MDMA that distinguish it from other stimulant drugs, especially as these effects relate to the reinforcing and potentially therapeutic effects of the drug.},

	abstract = {The brain’s serotonergic system plays a crucial role in the processing of emotional stimuli, and several studies have shown that a reduced serotonergic neurotransmission is associated with an increase in amygdala activity during emotional face processing. Prolonged recreational use of ecstasy (3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) induces alterations in serotonergic neurotransmission that are comparable to those observed in a depleted state. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the responsiveness of the amygdala to emotional face stimuli in recreational ecstasy users as a model of long-term serotonin depletion. Fourteen ecstasy users and 12 non-using controls underwent fMRI to measure the regional neural activity elicited in the amygdala by male or female faces expressing anger, disgust, fear, sadness, or no emotion. During fMRI, participants made a sex judgement on each face stimulus. Positron emission tomography with 11C-DASB was additionally performed to assess serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in the brain. In the ecstasy users, SERT binding correlated negatively with amygdala activity, and accumulated lifetime intake of ecstasy tablets was associated with an increase in amygdala activity during angry face processing. Conversely, time since the last ecstasy intake was associated with a trend toward a decrease in amygdala activity during angry and sad face processing. These results indicate that the effects of long-term serotonin depletion resulting from ecstasy use are dose-dependent, affecting the functional neural basis of emotional face processing.},

	abstract = {Background In both developed and developing countries, cardiovascular disease is on the rise, representing nowadays one of the main challenges for the health systems worldwide. This increase generates relevant costs. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic and meta-analytical review of the prevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran. Methods Articles written in English and Persian were searched from January 2000 to July 2017 in different scholarly databases. Results 12 studies were retained and included in the current meta-analysis. Selected studies were published between 2008 and 2016. The number of patients participating in these studies was 9292. Based on the random-effects model, the prevalence of depression in cardiovascular patients in Iran was 47\% [95\% confidence interval or CI 38–56], I2=98.2\% with P = 0.000. The relative risk (RR) of depression in cardiovascular patients yielded a value of 1.30 [95\%CI 1.05–1.62] with P {\textless} 0.001. Women are more at risk for depression than men. Conclusion The current meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of depression among cardiovascular patients in Iran. The prevalence found computed by the present study is higher than the figures found in developed countries. Depression with cardiovascular disease causes many problems for these patients, and early diagnosis and treatment significantly helps in improving quality of life, as well as saving costs and resources.},

Cross-region analysis of these 565 cell populations revealed features of brain organization, including a gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components, patterns in the co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels, functional distinctions among the cells of the vasculature and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions. Systematic neuronal classifications for two complex basal ganglia nuclei and the striatum revealed a rare population of spiny projection neurons. This adult mouse brain cell atlas, accessible through interactive online software (DropViz), serves as a reference for development, disease, and evolution.

They completed a standard online questionnaire for either mephedrone or MDMA. The questions covered the average amount taken per session, the longest duration of usage in the last 12-months, subjective effects while on-drug, and recovery effects in the days afterwards.Results: Mephedrone users reported a significantly longer maximum session of use than MDMA users. Mephedrone users also reported a significantly greater average amount used per session. The majority of on-drug subjective ratings did not differ between drugs, with similar increases in entactogenic effects. Although mephedrone users did report significantly more frequent issues with sleeping, anger and anxiety. In relation to recovery, mephedrone users reported more frequent craving, nasal irritation, paranoia, and relationship difficulties. Mephedrone users also rated general recovery effects as more severe over the seven-day period following use, taking more days to feel normal.Conclusions: The acute effects of MDMA and mephedrone were broadly similar. However, the recovery period for mephedrone was more enduring, possibly due to the longer duration of acute session usage.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the association between anxiety and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Background: Less research has focused on the association of anxiety with incident CHD in contrast to other negative emotions, such as depression. Methods: A meta-analysis of references derived from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO (1980 to May 2009) was performed without language restrictions. End points were cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and cardiac events. The authors selected prospective studies of (nonpsychiatric) cohorts of initially healthy persons in which anxiety was assessed at baseline. Results: Twenty studies reporting on incident CHD comprised 249,846 persons with a mean follow-up period of 11.2 years. Anxious persons were at risk of CHD (hazard ratio [HR] random: 1.26; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15 to 1.38; p {\textless} 0.0001) and cardiac death (HR: 1.48; 95\% CI: 1.14 to 1.92; p = 0.003), independent of demographic variables, biological risk factors, and health behaviors. There was a nonsignificant trend for an association between anxiety and nonfatal MI (HR: 1.43; 95\% CI: 0.85 to 2.40; p = 0.180). Subgroup analyses did not show any significant differences regarding study characteristics, with significant associations for different types of anxiety, short- and long-term follow-up, and both men and women. Conclusions: Anxiety seemed to be an independent risk factor for incident CHD and cardiac mortality. Future research should examine the association between anxiety and CHD with valid and reliable anxiety measures and focus on the mechanisms through which anxiety might affect CHD. © 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

	abstract = {RNA editing of adenosine residues to inosine ('A-to-I editing') is the most common RNA modification event detectible with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). While not directly detectable, inosine is read by next-generation sequencers as guanine. Therefore, mapping RNA-seq reads to their corresponding reference genome can detect potential editing events by identifying 'A-to-G' conversions. However, one must exercise caution when searching for editing sites, as A-to-G conversions also arise from sequencing errors as well as mutations. To address these complexities, several algorithms and software products have been developed to accurately identify editing events. Here, we survey currently available methods to analyze RNA editing events and introduce a new easy-to-use bioinformatics tool 'RNAEditor' for the detection of RNA editing events. During the development of RNAEditor, we noticed editing often happened in clusters, which we named 'editing islands'. We developed a clustering algorithm to find editing islands and included it in RNAEditor. RNAEditor is freely available at http:// rnaeditor.uni-frankfurt.de.We anticipate that RNAEditor will provide biologists with an easy-to-use tool for studying RNA editing events and the newly defined editing islands.},

	abstract = {Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, which is catalyzed by a family of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, is important in the epitranscriptomic regulation of RNA metabolism. However, the role of A-to-I RNA editing in vascular disease is unknown. Here we show that cathepsin S mRNA (CTSS), which encodes a cysteine protease associated with angiogenesis and atherosclerosis, is highly edited in human endothelial cells. The 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the CTSS transcript contains two inverted repeats, the AluJo and AluSx + regions, which form a long stem-loop structure that is recognized by ADAR1 as a substrate for editing. RNA editing enables the recruitment of the stabilizing RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR; encoded by ELAVL1) to the 3′ UTR of the CTSS transcript, thereby controlling CTSS mRNA stability and expression. In endothelial cells, ADAR1 overexpression or treatment of cells with hypoxia or with the inflammatory-γ 3 and tumor-necrosis-factor-α induces CTSS RNA editing and consequently increases cathepsin S expression. ADAR1 levels and the extent of CTSS RNA editing are associated with changes in cathepsin S levels in patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases, including subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysms and advanced carotid atherosclerotic disease. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of RNA editing in gene expression in human atherosclerotic vascular diseases.},

We benchmark HISAT2 using simulated and real datasets to demonstrate that our strategy of representing a population of genomes, together with a fast, memory-efficient search algorithm, provides more detailed and accurate variant analyses than other methods. We apply HISAT2 for HLA typing and DNA fingerprinting; both applications form part of the HISAT-genotype software that enables analysis of haplotype-resolved genes or genomic regions.

Here, we developed a unified computational framework, URSA HD (Unveiling RNA Sample Annotation for Human Diseases), that leverages machine learning and the hierarchy of anatomical relationships present among diseases to integrate thousands of clinical gene expression profiles and identify molecular characteristics specific to each of the hundreds of complex diseases. URSA HD can distinguish between closely related diseases more accurately than literature-validated genes or traditional differential-expression-based computational approaches and is applicable to any disease, including rare and understudied ones. We demonstrate the utility of URSA HD in classifying related nervous system cancers and experimentally verifying novel neuroblastoma-associated genes identified by URSA HD . We highlight the applications for potential targeted drug-repurposing and for quantitatively assessing the molecular response to clinical therapies. URSA HD is freely available for public use, including the use of underlying models, at ursahd.princeton.edu. Discovering unique properties among diseases is needed to develop targeted treatments, especially for related disorders. To address this, we developed a unified framework, URSA HD , which leverages physiological relationships between diseases and integrates thousands of clinical samples across {\textgreater}300 diseases to identify distinct characteristics that can be used to guide biomedical research.

Physiological health measures (body mass index, weight, glucose levels, lipid profiles and blood pressure) were secondary outcomes (14 reviews). RESULTS Antipsychotic and antidepressant medications had some protective effect on mortality, subject to treatment adherence. Integrative community care programmes may reduce physical morbidity and excess deaths, but the effective ingredients are unknown. Interventions to improve unhealthy lifestyles and risky behaviours can improve risk factor profiles, but longer follow-up is needed.

However, evidence is focused on individually delivered therapies, with less evidence for group-based therapies. AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of group-based psychological therapies for depression in primary care and the community. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group database from inception to July 2010. The Cochrane risk of bias methodology was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included. The majority showed considerable risk of bias. Analysis of group cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) v. usual care alone (14 studies) showed a significant effect in favour of group CBT immediately post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55 (95\% CI -0.78 to -0.32)). There was some evidence of benefit being maintained at short-term (SMD = -0.47 (95\% CI -1.06 to 0.12)) and medium- to long-term follow-up (SMD = -0.47 (95\% CI - 0.87 to -0.08)). Studies of group CBT v. individually delivered CBT therapy (7 studies) showed a moderate treatment effect in favour of individually delivered CBT immediately post-treatment (SMD = 0.38 (95\% CI 0.09-0.66)) but no evidence of difference at short- or medium- to long-term follow-up. Four studies described comparisons for three other types of group psychological therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Group CBT confers benefit for individuals who are clinically depressed over that of usual care alone. Individually delivered CBT is more effective than group CBT immediately following treatment but after 3 months there is no evidence of difference. The quality of evidence is poor. Evidence about group psychological therapies not based on CBT is particularly limited.},

	abstract = {Research from several domains indicates that genetic factors, childhood environment, and later interpersonal experiences are important sources of how patients relate to their therapists (transference). Transference work, a core specific technique in psychodynamic psychotherapy, focuses on exploring the patient-therapist relationship, with the idea that this may lead to improvement of the patients' relationships outside therapy. Many psychotherapy researchers hold the position that specific techniques do not contribute much to the outcome of psychotherapy. However, more than 30 studies have reported significant associations between transference work and outcome. These findings indicate that transference work interventions are indeed active ingredients (for better or worse). Naturalistic studies suggest that a high frequency of transference interventions may have negative effects. Randomized clinical trials indicate that transference-based treatments and alternative treatments work equally well with regard to symptom improvement. However, transference-based treatments appear to be much more effective with regard to interpersonal relations and other measures of personality functioning. The average between-groups effect size for the experimental studies listed in this article was large. Contrary to common clinical wisdom, transference interventions seem to be most important for (mainly female) patients with difficult interpersonal relationships and more severe personality pathology. Gain of insight may be a specific mechanism of change in dynamic psychotherapy, but only one treatment component study has linked transference work directly to gains in insight and subsequent improvement in interpersonal functioning. Research that examines how transference phenomena may be responded to in nondynamic therapies is scarce.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:In this review, based on recent advances in cognitive neuroscience, the author presents a formulation in which the marked persistence of anorexia nervosa can be usefully understood as a well-ingrained maladaptive habit.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD:The author reviewed the relevant literature on the development and course of anorexia nervosa and interpreted critical features in light of developments in cognitive neuroscience.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS:Anorexia nervosa is a well characterized disorder with remarkable persistence both across history and among affected individuals. Food restriction, the salient behavioral feature of the disorder, often begins innocently but gradually takes on a life of its own. Over time, it becomes highly entrenched and resistant to change through either psychological or pharmacological treatment. Cognitive neuroscience has described two related but distinct processes that underlie the acquisition of new patterns of behavior, namely, action-outcome and stimulus-response learning. It is likely that both processes are engaged in the development of anorexia nervosa and that stimulus-response learning (that is, habit formation) is critical to the persistence of the dieting behavior.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS:The formulation of the dieting behavior characteristic of anorexia nervosa as a well-entrenched habit provides a basis for understanding the striking persistence of this disorder. This model helps explain the resistance of anorexia nervosa to interventions that have established efficacy in related disorders and implies that addressing the dieting behavior is critical, especially early in the course of the illness, before it has become ingrained.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with bipolar disorder have high levels of cardiovascular disease risk factors. The presence of metabolic syndrome significantly influences future cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The authors sought to clarify the prevalence and moderators of metabolic syndrome in bipolar patients, accounting for subgroup differences. METHOD: The authors searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL through April 2012 for research reporting metabolic syndrome prevalence rates in bipolar patients. Medical subject headings "metabolic syndrome" and "bipolar" were used in the title, abstract, or index term fields. Manual searches were conducted using the reference lists from identified articles. RESULTS: The search yielded 81 articles in 37 publications (N=6,983). The overall metabolic syndrome rate was 37.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]=36.1-39.0) using any standardized metabolic syndrome criteria. Compared with general population groups, bipolar patients had higher metabolic syndrome rates (odds ratio=1.98; 95\% CI=1.74-2.25). In bipolar patients, older age had a modest effect on the metabolic syndrome rate. The strongest moderator was the region in which the study took place, with the highest rates observed in New Zealand and Australia (64.2\% [95\% CI=38.3-83.9]) and North America (49.3\% [95\% CI=29.7-69.3]). Metabolic syndrome was significantly more prevalent in patients currently treated with antipsychotics (45.3\% [95\% CI=39.6-50.9] than in patients who were antipsychotic free (32.4\% [95\% CI=27.5-37.4]; odds ratio=1.72 [95\% CI=1.24-2.38]). CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly support the claim that patients with bipolar disorder are at high risk for metabolic syndrome and related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and require regular monitoring and adequate preventive efforts and treatment for cardio-metabolic risk factors. These findings further suggest that the risk of metabolic syndrome is greater in bipolar patients taking prescribed antipsychotic medication.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although tribes differ with regard to the use of alcohol and drugs, substance dependence is one of the primary sources of health problems facing Native Americans. General population studies have demonstrated that substance dependence has a substantially heritable component (approximately 50\% of the risk resulting from genetic influences); however, fewer studies have investigated the role of genetics in the risk for substance dependence in Native Americans.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: The authors present a literature review of the evidence for a genetic component in the etiology of substance dependence in Native Americans, including studies of heritability, linkage analyses, and candidate genes.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Evidence for the heritability of alcohol and drug dependence was found. Linkage analyses revealed that genes influencing risk for substance dependence and related phenotypes, such as body mass index (BMI), drug tolerance, EEG patterns, and externalizing traits, reside on several chromosome regions identified in other population samples. Overlap in the gene locations for substance dependence and BMI suggests that a common genetic substrate may exist for disorders of consumption. Studies of the genes that code for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes have not revealed any risk variants specific to Native American populations, although most Native Americans lack protective variants seen in other populations. Other candidate genes associated with substance dependence phenotypes in Native Americans include OPRM1, CRN1, COMT, GABRA2, MAOA, and HTR3-B.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Substance dependence has a substantial genetic component in Native Americans, similar in magnitude to that reported for other populations. The high rates of substance dependence seen in some tribes is likely a combination of a lack of genetic protective factors (metabolizing enzyme variants) combined with genetically mediated risk factors (externalizing traits, consumption drive, and drug sensitivity or tolerance) that combine with key environmental factors (trauma exposure, early age at onset of use, and environmental hardship) to produce an elevated risk for the disorder.},

	abstract = {There is robust evidence from epidemiological studies that the offspring of older fathers have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. The authors present a novel mechanism that may contribute to this association. Because the male germ cell undergoes many more cell divisions across the reproductive age range, copy errors taking place in the paternal germline are associated with de novo mutations in the offspring of older men. Recently it has been recognized that somatic mutations in male germ cells that modify proliferation through dysregulation of the RAS protein pathway can lead to within-testis expansion of mutant clonal lines. First identified in association with rare disorders related to paternal age (e.g., Apert syndrome, achondroplasia), this process is known as "selfish spermatogonial selection." This mechanism favors propagation of germ cells carrying pathogenic mutations, increasingly skews the mutational profile of sperm as men age, and enriches de novo mutations in the offspring of older fathers that preferentially affect specific cellular signaling pathways. This mechanism not only offers a parsimonious explanation for the association between advanced paternal age and various neurodevelopmental disorders but also provides insights into the genetic architecture (role of de novo mutations), neurobiological correlates (altered cell cycle), and some epidemiological features of these disorders. The authors outline hypotheses to test this model. Given the secular changes for delayed parenthood in most societies, this hypothesis has important public health implications.},

Coexistence or rapid alternation of depressive and manic symptoms in the same episode may indicate a more severe form of bipolar disorder and may pose diagnostic and treatment challenges. However, definitions of mixed states, especially those with prominent depression, are not well established.MethodThe authors performed literature searches for bipolar disorder, multivariate analyses, and the appearance of the terms “mixed” in any field; references selected from the articles found after the search were combined after a series of conferences among the authors.ResultsThe authors reviewed the evolution of the concept of mixed states and examined the symptom structure of mixed states studied as predominantly manic, predominantly depressive, and across both manic and depressive episodes, showing essentially parallel structures of mixed states based on manic or depressive episodes. The authors analyzed the relationships between mixed states and a severely recurrent course of illness in bipolar disorder, with early onset and increased co-occurring anxiety-, stress-, and substance-related disorders, and they used this information to derive proposed diagnostic criteria for research or clinical use.ConclusionsThe definitions and properties of mixed states have generated controversy, but the stability of their characteristics over a range of clinical definitions and diagnostic methods shows that the concept of mixed states is robust. Distinct characteristics related to the course of illness emerge at relatively modest opposite polarity symptom levels in depressive or manic episodes.},

The authors review the existing empirical findings, some of which may call into question current clinical pharmacotherapy practices for treating co-occurring mood and substance use disorders. The authors also highlight knowledge gaps that can serve as a basis for future research. The specific mood disorders reviewed are bipolar and major depressive disorders (either one co-occurring with a substance use disorder). Overall, findings from the relatively small amount of available data indicate that pharmacotherapy for managing mood symptoms can be effective in patients with substance dependence, although results have not been consistent across all studies. Also, in most studies, medications for managing mood symptoms did not appear to have an impact on the substance use disorder. In a recent trial for comorbid major depression and alcohol dependence, combination treatment with a medication for depression and another for alcohol dependence was found to reduce depressive symptoms and excessive drinking simultaneously. However, research has only begun to address optimal pharmacologic management of co-occurring disorders. In addition, current clinical treatment for alcohol and drug dependence often excludes new pharmacotherapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating certain types of addiction. With new data becoming available, it appears that we need to revisit current practice in the pharmacological management of co-occurring mood and substance use disorders.},

	abstract = {A task force report presents 12 recommendations for antidepressant use in bipolar disorder rated by at least 80\% of International Society for Bipolar Disorders experts as essential or important. Objective The risk-benefit profile of antidepressant medications in bipolar disorder is controversial. When conclusive evidence is lacking, expert consensus can guide treatment decisions. The International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) convened a task force to seek consensus recommendations on the use of antidepressants in bipolar disorders. Method An expert task force iteratively developed consensus through serial consensus-based revisions using the Delphi method. Initial survey items were based on systematic review of the literature. Subsequent surveys included new or reworded items and items that needed to be rerated. This process resulted in the final ISBD Task Force clinical recommendations on antidepressant use in bipolar disorder. Results There is striking incongruity between the wide use of and the weak evidence base for the efficacy and safety of antidepressant drugs in bipolar disorder. Few well-designed, long-term trials of prophylactic benefits have been conducted, and there is insufficient evidence for treatment benefits with antidepressants combined with mood stabilizers. A major concern is the risk for mood switch to hypomania, mania, and mixed states. Integrating the evidence and the experience of the task force members, a consensus was reached on 12 statements on the use of antidepressants in bipolar disorder. Conclusions Because of limited data, the task force could not make broad statements endorsing antidepressant use but acknowledged that individual bipolar patients may benefit from antidepressants. Regarding safety, serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bupropion may have lower rates of manic switch than tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The frequency and severity of antidepressant-associated mood elevations appear to be greater in bipolar I than bipolar II disorder. Hence, in bipolar I patients antidepressants should be prescribed only as an adjunct to mood-stabilizing medications.},

The effect of such models across other treatment settings and mental health conditions has not been comprehensively assessed. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the comparative effectiveness of CCMs for mental health conditions across disorders and treatment settings. Method: Randomized controlled trials comparing CCMs with other care conditions, published or in press by August 15, 2011, were identified in a literature search and through contact with investigators. CCMs were defined a priori as interventions with at least three of the six components of the Improving Chronic Illness Care initiative (patient self-management support, clinical information systems, delivery system redesign, decision support, organizational support, and community resource linkages). Articles were included if the CCM effect on mental health symptoms or mental quality of life was reported. Data extraction included analyses of these outcomes plus social role function, physical and overall quality of life, and costs. Meta-analyses included comparisons using unadjusted continuous measures. Results: Seventy-eight articles yielded 161 analyses from 57 trials (depression, N=40; bipolar disorder, N=4; anxiety disorders, N=3; multiple/other disorders, N=10). The meta-analysis indicated significant effects across disorders and care settings for depression as well as for mental and physical quality of life and social role function (Cohen's d values, 0.20–0.33). Total health care costs did not differ between CCMs and comparison models. A systematic review largely confirmed and extended these findings across conditions and outcome domains. Conclusions: CCMs can improve mental and physical outcomes for individuals with mental disorders across a wide variety of care settings, and they provide a robust clinical and policy framework for care integration.},

In this proposed model, high baseline pulvinar activity in depression first potentiates responding of the brain's salience network to negative information; next, and owing potentially to low striatal dopamine levels in depression, this viscerally charged information fails to propagate up the cortical-striatal-pallidalthalamic circuit to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for contextual processing and reappraisal.},

Such apparent discrepancies, which have come to be termed the "emotion paradox" in schizophrenia, have complicated our understanding of what anhedonia actually reflects in this patient population. The authors sought to resolve this paradox. METHOD: The authors reviewed the empirical literature on anhedonia and emotional experience in schizophrenia through the lens of the accessibility model of emotional self-report, a well-validated model of emotional self-report developed in the affective science literature that clarifies the sources of emotion knowledge that individuals access when providing different types of self-report. The authors used this model to propose a resolution to the "emotion paradox" and to provide a new psychological conceptualization of anhedonia. RESULTS: Data are presented in support of this new perspective on anhedonia and to demonstrate how cognitive impairments may influence reports of noncurrent feelings in schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that anhedonia should no longer be considered an experiential deficit or a diminished "capacity" for pleasure in patients with schizophrenia. Rather, anhedonia reflects a set of beliefs related to low pleasure that surface when patients are asked to report their noncurrent feelings. Encoding and retrieval processes may serve to maintain these beliefs despite contrary real-world pleasurable experiences. Implications for assessment and treatment are discussed in relation to this new conceptualization of anhedonia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Striatal dopamine transporter abnormalities are thought to underlie the pathophysiology and psychostimulant treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, individual studies using single photon emission tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) have yielded inconsistent results, i.e., both high and low striatal dopamine transporter levels. METHOD: Nine SPECT and PET studies investigating striatal dopamine transporter density in ADHD patients (N=169) and age-, gender-, and IQ-matched healthy comparison subjects (N=173) were included in a quantitative meta-analysis. Binding potentials in the striatum and demographic, clinical, and methodological variables were extracted from each publication or obtained directly from authors. Hedges' g was used as a measure of effect size in an analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger's intercept. Heterogeneity was addressed with the Q statistic and I2 index. RESULTS: Striatal dopamine transporter density was 14\% higher on average in the ADHD group than in the healthy comparison group. However, heterogeneity across studies was large and statistically significant. Meta-regression analyses showed that the percentage of subjects without exposure to psychostimulants was negatively correlated with dopamine transporter density; density was higher in patients with previous medication exposure and lower in medication-naive patients. There was no moderating effect for age, comorbidity, gender, year of publication, or imaging technique. There was no publication bias, and sensitivity analysis confirmed robustness of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Striatal dopamine transporter density in ADHD appears to depend on previous psychostimulant exposure, with lower density in drug-naive subjects and higher density in previously medicated patients.},

	abstract = {Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that a single subpsychotomimetic dose of ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, produces a rapid antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder, with effects lasting up to 2 weeks. Despite enthusiasm about this unexpected efficacy of ketamine, its widespread use as a fast-acting antidepressant in routine clinical settings is curtailed by its abuse potential as well as possible psychotomimetic effects. However, the ability of ketamine to produce a rapid and long-lasting antidepressant response in patients with depression provides a unique opportunity for investigation of mechanisms that mediate these clinically relevant behavioral effects. From a mechanistic perspective, it is easy to imagine how activation of NMDA receptors may trigger cellular and behavioral responses; it is relatively more difficult, however, to envision how transient blockade of one of the key pathways for neuronal communication produces a persistent beneficial effect. The authors discuss recent work linking ketamine's mechanism of action to homeostatic synaptic plasticity processes activated after suppression of NMDA-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. They focus on their recent work demonstrating that ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDA receptors at rest deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, resulting in reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and desuppression of rapid dendritic protein translation, including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which then contributes to synaptic plasticity mechanisms that mediate longterm effects of the drug. The authors also explore possible molecular strategies to target spontaneous neurotransmitter release selectively to help uncover novel presynaptic avenues for the development of fast-acting antidepressants and possibly psychoactive compounds with effectiveness against other neuropsychiatric disorders.},

The author provides a qualitative synthesis of results focusing on ADHD and the association with bipolar disorder in prospectively assessed high-risk offspring. These results are discussed in light of findings from other prospective epidemiological and clinical cohort studies.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: From the reviewed high-risk studies, evidence suggests that the clinical diagnosis of childhood ADHD is not a reliable predictor of the development of bipolar disorder. However, the author found evidence that symptoms of inattention may be part of a mixed clinical presentation during the early stages of evolving bipolar disorder in high-risk offspring, appearing alongside anxiety and depressive symptoms. The author also found preliminary evidence that childhood ADHD may form part of a neurodevelopmental phenotype in offspring at risk for developing a subtype of bipolar disorder unresponsive to lithium stabilization.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: While childhood ADHD does not appear to be part of the typical developmental illness trajectory of bipolar disorder, subjective problems with attention can form part of the early course, while neurodevelopmental abnormalities may be antecedents in a subgroup of high-risk children.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The existence of comorbidity between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar I disorder has been documented in clinical and epidemiological studies, in studies of children and adults, and in diagnosed ADHD and bipolar I patient samples. Yet questions remain about the validity of diagnosing bipolar I disorder in ADHD youth. The authors aim to clarify these issues by reviewing family genetic studies of ADHD and bipolar I disorder. METHOD The authors applied random-effects meta-analysis to family genetic studies of ADHD and bipolar I disorder. Twenty bipolar proband studies provided 37 estimates of the prevalence of ADHD in 4,301 relatives of bipolar probands and 1,937 relatives of comparison probands. Seven ADHD proband studies provided 12 estimates of the prevalence of bipolar I disorder in 1,877 relatives of ADHD probands and 1,601 relatives of comparison probands. RESULTS These studies found a significantly higher prevalence of ADHD among relatives of bipolar probands and a significantly higher prevalence of bipolar I disorder among relatives of ADHD probands. These results could not be accounted for by publication biases, unusual results from any one observation, sample characteristics, or study design features. The authors found no evidence of heterogeneity in the ADHD or bipolar family studies. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that ADHD plus bipolar comorbidity cannot be accounted for by misdiagnoses, but additional research is needed to rule out artifactual sources of comorbidity. More research is also needed to determine whether comorbidity of ADHD and bipolar I disorder constitutes a familial subtype distinct from its constituent disorders, which if confirmed would have implications for diagnostic nosology and genetic studies.},

	abstract = {Characterization of developmental trajectories across the lifespan is integral to understanding the prodromal course of many neuropsychiatric illnesses and the significant risk factors for disease onset or unfavorable outcomes. However, the standard experimental designs used in psychiatric research are not ideal for this purpose. The authors review the limitations of the most commonly employed designs in studies that make developmental or lifespan inferences in psychiatry: cross-sectional, single-cohort longitudinal, and unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs. Cross-sectional studies completely confound within- and between-subject sources of variation and hence rely on the presence of parallel trajectories and negligible sampling and age cohort differences for making valid developmental inferences. Delineating trajectories of within-individual change over substantial periods of time requires data covering long age spans that often cannot be covered using single-cohort longitudinal designs. Unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs are a commonly used alternative that can cover a longer age span in a shorter interval than necessary for a single-cohort design. However, the impact of cohort and sampling effects is often minimized or ignored in unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs. The authors propose that structured multicohort longitudinal designs are a particularly viable and underutilized class of designs in psychiatry that represents a significant improvement over cross-sectional designs and unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs for making developmental inferences while being more practical to implement than single-cohort longitudinal designs. As an example of this approach, the authors analyze changes in entorhinal cortex thickness in Alzheimer's disease in relation to APOE-epsilon4 genotype},

The linked region contains the gene GRM7, which encodes a protein for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7). Both studies used affected sibling pairs, and neither was able to replicate its finding using association studies in individuals from larger population-based studies. Other family-based studies have also failed to find a signal in this region. Furthermore, there are some differences in how the phenotype was classified, with Breen et al. finding evidence only in the most severely affected patients. Nonetheless, the finding is not without other substantive support. A meta-analysis of 3,957 case subjects with major depressive disorder and 3,428 control subjects from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), Genetics of Recurrent Early-onset Depression (GenRED), and the Genetic Association Information Network-MDD (GAIN-MDD) data sets demonstrated a region of association for major depressive disorder within GRM7.

	abstract = {Objective: Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), a structured and time-limited therapy, has been studied in many controlled trials. Numerous practice guidelines have recommended IPT as a treatment of choice for unipolar depressive disorders. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to integrate research on the effects of IPT. Method: The authors searched bibliographical databases for randomized controlled trials comparing IPT with no treatment, usual care, other psychological treatments, and pharmacotherapy as well as studies comparing combination treatment using pharmacotherapy and IPT. Maintenance studies were also included. Results: Thirty-eight studies including 4,356 patients met all inclusion criteria. The overall effect size (Cohen's d) of the 16 studies that compared IPT and a control group was 0.63 (95\% confidence interval [CI]=0.36 to 0.90), corresponding to a number needed to treat of 2.91. Ten studies comparing IPT and other psychological treatments showed a nonsignificant differential effect size of 0.04 (95\% CI=-0.14 to 0.21; number needed to treat=45.45) favoring IPT. Pharmacotherapy (after removal of one outlier) was more effective than IPT (d=-0.19, 95\% CI=-0.38 to -0.01; number needed to treat=9.43), and combination treatment was not more effective than IPT alone, although the paucity of studies precluded drawing definite conclusions. Combination maintenance treatment with pharmacotherapy and IPT was more effective in preventing relapse than pharmacotherapy alone (odds ratio=0.37; 95\% CI=0.19 to 0.73; number needed to treat=7.63). Conclusions: There is no doubt that IPT efficaciously treats depression, both as an independent treatment and in combination with pharmacotherapy.

	abstract = {Ten years ago it was widely expected that the genetic basis of common disease would be resolved by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), large-scale studies in which the entire genome is covered by genetic markers. However, the bulk of heritable variance remains unexplained. The authors consider several alternative research strategies. For instance, whereas it has been hypothesized that a common disease is associated primarily with common genetic variants, it is now plausible that multiple rare variants each have a potent effect on disease risk and that they could accumulate to become a substantial component of common disease risk. This idea has become more appealing since the discovery that copy number variants (CNVs) are a substantial source of human mutations and are associated with multiple common diseases. CNVs are structural genomic variants consisting of microinsertions, microdeletions, and transpositions in the human genome. It has been argued that numerous rare CNVs are plausible causes of a substantial proportion of common disease, and rare CNVs have been found to be potent risk factors in schizophrenia and autism. Another approach is to "parse the genome," i.e., reanalyze subsets of current GWAS data, since the noise inherent in genome-wide approaches may be hiding valid associations. Lastly, technological advances and declining costs may allow large-scale genome-wide sequencing that would comprehensively identify all genetic variants. Study groups even larger than the 10,000 subjects in current meta-analyses would be required, but the outcomes may lead to resolution of our current dilemma in common diseases: Where is the missing heritability?},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Structural neuroimaging studies in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been relatively inconsistent and have mainly been conducted with pediatric samples. Furthermore, there is evidence that stimulant medication may have an effect on brain structure. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies in children and adults with ADHD and examined the potential effects of age and stimulant medication on regional gray matter volumes. METHOD The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus databases were searched for articles published between 2001 and 2011. Manual searches were also conducted, and authors of studies were contacted for additional data. Coordinates were extracted from clusters of significant gray matter difference between ADHD patients and healthy comparison subjects. Metaregression methods were used to explore potential age and stimulant medication effects. RESULTS Fourteen data sets comprising 378 patients with ADHD and 344 healthy subjects met inclusion criteria. The ADHD group had global reductions in gray matter volumes, which were robustly localized in the right lentiform nucleus and extended to the caudate nucleus. Both increasing age and percentage of patients taking stimulant medication were found to be independently associated with more normal values in this region. Patients also had slightly greater gray matter volumes in the left posterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS These findings confirm that the most prominent and replicable structural abnormalities in ADHD are in the basal ganglia. They furthermore suggest that ADHD patients may progressively catch up with their developmental delay with advancing age and that use of stimulant medication may be associated with normalization of structural abnormalities in ADHD, although longitudinal studies are needed to confirm both observations.},

The National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria position these deficits as intermediaries between molecular and cellular mechanisms and clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations. The prepulse inhibition of startle responses by a weaker preceding tone, the inhibitory gating of response to paired sensory stimuli characterized using the auditory P50 evoked response, and the detection of slight deviations in patterns of sensory stimulation eliciting the cortical mismatch negativity potential demonstrate deficits in early sensory processing mechanisms, whose molecular and neurobiological bases are increasingly well understood. Deficits in sensory processing underlie more complex cognitive dysfunction and are in turn affected by higher-level cognitive difficulties. These deficits are now being used to identify genes involved in familial transmission of schizophrenia and to monitor potentially therapeutic drug effects for both treatment and prevention. This research also provides a clinical reminder that patients' sensory perception of the surrounding world, even during treatment sessions, may differ considerably from others' perceptions. A person's ability to understand and interact effectively with the surrounding world ultimately depends on an underlying sensory experience of it.},

Whether serotonergic abnormalities observed in individuals who have died by suicide are independent of stress response abnormalities is an unresolved question.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The most compelling biomarkers for suicide are linked to altered stress responses and their downstream effects, and to abnormalities in the serotonergic system.

	abstract = {Objective: Gene-by-environment interaction (GxE) studies in psychiatry have typically been conducted using a candidate GxE (cGxE) approach, analogous to the candidate gene association approach used to test genetic main effects. Such cGxE research has received widespread attention and acclaim, yet cGxE findings remain controversial. The authors examined whether the many positive cGxE findings reported in the psychiatric literature were robust or if, in aggregate, cGxE findings were consistent with the existence of publication bias, low statistical power, and a high false discovery rate. Method: The authors conducted analyses on data extracted from all published studies (103 studies) from the first decade (2000-2009) of cGxE research in psychiatry. Results: Ninety-six percent of novel cGxE studies were significant compared with 27\% of replication attempts. These findings are consistent with the existence of publication bias among novel cGxE studies, making cGxE hypotheses appear more robust than they actually are. There also appears to be publication bias among replication attempts because positive replication attempts had smaller average sample sizes than negative ones. Power calculations using observed sample sizes suggest that cGxE studies are underpowered. Low power along with the likely low prior probability of a given cGxE hypothesis being true suggests that most or even all positive cGxE findings represent type I errors. Conclusions: In this new era of big data and small effects, a recalibration of views about groundbreaking findings is necessary. Well-powered direct replications deserve more attention than novel cGxE findings and indirect replications.},

	abstract = {This review brings together recent research from molecular, neural circuit, animal model, and human studies to help understand the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder is common and debilitating, and it often leads to further psychopathology. Numerous studies have demonstrated that extremely behaviorally inhibited and temperamentally anxious young children are at marked risk of developing social anxiety disorder. Recent work in human and nonhuman primates has identified a distributed brain network that underlies early-life anxiety including the central nucleus of the amygdala, the anterior hippocampus, and the orbitofrontal cortex. Studies in nonhuman primates have demonstrated that alterations in this circuit are trait-like in that they are stable over time and across contexts. Notably, the components of this circuit are differentially influenced by heritable and environmental factors, and specific lesion studies have demonstrated a causal role for multiple components of the circuit. Molecular studies in rodents and primates point to disrupted neurodevelopmental and neuroplastic processes within critical components of the early-life dispositional anxiety neural circuit. The possibility of identifying an early-life at-risk phenotype, along with an understanding of its neurobiology, provides an unusual opportunity to conceptualize novel preventive intervention strategies aimed at reducing the suffering of anxious children and preventing them from developing further psychopathology.},

Because these and other important confounders of MRI data (e.g., smoking, body weight, metabolic variations, medical comorbidities, psychoactive drugs, alcohol use, mental state) tend to vary systematically between patient and control groups, the evidence that findings are neurobiologically meaningful is inconclusive and may represent artifacts or epiphenomena of uncertain value.

	abstract = {The hippocampal formation is one of the most extensively studied regions of the brain, with well-described anatomy and basic physiology; moreover, aspects of human memory mediated by the hippocampus are well characterized. In schizophrenia, alterations in hippocampal anatomy, perfusion, and activation are consistently reported; impairments in declarative memory function, especially in the flexible use of event memories (e.g., in the service of memory-based inference), are common. Postmortem molecular changes suggest a selective reduction in glutamate transmission in the dentate gyrus and in its efferent fibers, the mossy fiber pathway. A reduction in dentate gyrus glutamatergic output and in its information processing functions could generate two co-occurring outcomes in the hippocampus: 1) a change in homeostatic plasticity processes in cornu ammonis 3 (CA3), accompanied by increased activity due to reduced afferent stimulation from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 neurons, a process that could increase the pattern completion functions of CA3, and 2) the loss of mnemonic functions specific to the dentate gyrus, namely pattern separation, a change that could increase the prevalence of illusory pattern completion and reduce discrimination between present and past experiences in memory. The resulting increase in "runaway" CA3-mediated pattern completion could result in cognitive "mistakes," generating psychotic associations and resulting in memories with psychotic content. Tests of this model could result in novel approaches to the treatment of psychosis and declarative memory alterations and in novel animal preparations for basic schizophrenia research.},

In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of CNVs, review recent findings related to schizophrenia, outline implications for clinical practice and diagnostic subtyping, and make recommendations for future reports on CNVs to improve interpretation of results.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: The review included genome-wide surveys of CNVs in schizophrenia that included one or more comparison groups, were published before 2009, and used newer methods. Six studies were identified.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Despite some limitations, these initial genome-wide studies of CNVs provide replicated associations of schizophrenia with rare 1q21.1 and 15q13.3 deletions. Collectively, the results point to a more general mutational mechanism involving rare CNVs that elevate risk for schizophrenia, especially more developmental forms of the disease. Including 22q11.2 deletions, rare risk-associated CNVs appear to account for up to 2\% of schizophrenia.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The more penetrant CNVs have direct implications for clinical practice and diagnostic subtyping. CNVs with lower penetrance promise to contribute to our genetic understanding of pathogenesis.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence suggest that antipsychotic drug efficacy is mediated by dopamine type 2 (D(2)) receptor blockade. Therefore, it seems plausible that variation in the DRD(2) gene is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment. The authors conducted the first meta-analysis to examine the relationship between DRD2 polymorphisms and antipsychotic drug response. METHOD: A MEDLINE search of articles available up to December 31, 2008, yielded 18 prospective studies examining DRD2 gene variation and antipsychotic response in schizophrenia patients; of which, 10 independent studies met criteria for inclusion. Clinical response to antipsychotic treatment was defined as a 50\% reduction of either the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at approximately 8 weeks of follow-up evaluation. Odds ratio was the primary effect-size measure and computed for each polymorphism in each study. Sufficient data were available for two DRD2 polymorphisms: -141C Ins/Del and Taq1A. RESULTS: Six studies reported results for the -141C Ins/Del polymorphism (total sample size: N=687). The Del allele carrier was significantly associated with poorer antipsychotic drug response relative to the Ins/Ins genotype. Eight studies assessed the Taq1A polymorphism and antipsychotic response (total sample size: N=748). There was no significant difference in the response rate among A1 allele carriers relative to individuals with the A2/A2 genotype or A2 allele carriers relative to individuals with the A1/A1 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The DRD2 genetic variation is associated with clinical response to antipsychotic drug treatment. These data may provide proof-of-principle for pharmacogenetic studies in schizophrenia.},

Biological factors, such as genotype and neurobiology, interact with environmental factors, such as childhood background and trauma load, to affect vulnerability and resilience in the aftermath of trauma exposure. One of the core symptoms of PTSD is the inability to control fear, which has led some investigators and clinicians to conceptualize PTSD as a disorder of fear or, more importantly, its inhibition.

	doi = {10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.09081168},
	abstract = {In this article, the authors present evidence regarding a dissociative subtype of PTSD, with clinical and neurobiological features that can be distinguished from nondissociative PTSD. The dissociative subtype is characterized by overmodulation of affect, while the more common undermodulated type involves the predominance of reexperiencing and hyperarousal symptoms. This article focuses on the neural manifestations of the dissociative subtype in PTSD and compares it to those underlying the reexperiencing/hyperaroused subtype. A model that includes these two types of emotion dysregulation in PTSD is described. In this model, reexperiencing/hyperarousal reactivity is viewed as a form of emotion dysregulation that involves emotional undermodulation, mediated by failure of prefrontal inhibition of limbic regions. In contrast, the dissociative subtype of PTSD is described as a form of emotion dysregulation that involves emotional overmodulation mediated by midline prefrontal inhibition of the same limbic regions. Both types of modulation are involved in a dynamic interplay and lead to alternating symptom profiles in PTSD. These findings have important implications for treatment of PTSD, including the need to assess patients with PTSD for dissociative symptoms and to incorporate the treatment of dissociative symptoms into stage-oriented trauma treatment.},

The study of such Gene-by-Environment (GxE) interactions has gained momentum. In this article, the authors review research about one of the most extensive areas of inquiry: variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4; also known as 5-HTT) and its contribution to stress sensitivity. Research in this area has both advanced basic science and generated broader lessons for studying complex diseases and traits. The authors evaluate four lines of evidence about the 5-HTT stress-sensitivity hypothesis: 1) observational studies about the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), stress sensitivity, and depression in humans; 2) experimental neuroscience studies about the 5-HTTLPR and biological phenotypes relevant to the human stress response; 3) studies of 5-HTT variation and stress sensitivity in nonhuman primates; and 4) studies of stress sensitivity and genetically engineered 5-HTT mutations in rodents. The authors then dispel some misconceptions and offer recommendations for GxE research. The authors discuss how GxE interaction hypotheses can be tested with large and small samples, how GxE research can be carried out before as well as after replicated gene discovery, the uses of GxE research as a tool for gene discovery, the importance of construct validation in evaluating GxE research, and the contribution of GxE research to the public understanding of genetic science.},

In the 1950s, when American psychiatry under psychoanalytic dominance had little interest in psychiatric diagnosis, Edwin Gildea recruited to the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University faculty who advocated a medical model for psychiatry in which diagnosis had a central role. In 1967, at the urging of the then-resident John Feighner, a discussion group led by Eli Robins and including Sam Guze, George Winokur, Robert Woodruff, and Rod Muñoz began meeting with the initial goal of writing a review of prior key contributions to psychiatric diagnosis. In their meetings over the next year, the task soon shifted to the development of a set of new diagnostic criteria. For three diagnoses, major depression, antisocial personality disorder, and alcoholism, the authors could identify the original criteria from which this group worked and the rationale for many of the changes they introduced. Published in 1972, the Feighner criteria were soon widely cited and used in research, and they formed the basis for the development of the Research Diagnostic Criteria, which in turn were central to the development of DSM-III. The team that developed the Feighner criteria made three key contributions to psychiatry: the systematic use of operationalized diagnostic criteria; the reintroduction of an emphasis on illness course and outcome; and an emphasis on the need, whenever possible, to base diagnostic criteria on empirical evidence.},

	abstract = {Depression and inflammation fuel one another. Inflammation plays a key role in depression's pathogenesis for a subset of depressed individuals; depression also primes larger cytokine responses to stressors and pathogens that do not appear to habituate. Accordingly, treatment decisions may be informed by attention to questions of how (pathways) and for whom (predispositions) these links exist, which are the focus of this article. When combined with predisposing factors (modera-tors such as childhood adversity and obesity), stressors and pathogens can lead to exaggerated or prolonged inflammatory responses. The resulting sickness behaviors (e.g., pain, dis-turbed sleep), depressive symptoms, and negative health behaviors (e.g., poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle) may act as mediating pathways that lead to further, unrestrained in-flammation and depression. Depression, childhood adversity, stressors, and diet can all influence the gut microbiome and promote intestinal permeability, another pathway to enhanced inflammatory responses. Larger, more frequent, or more prolonged inflammatory responses could have negative mental and physical health consequences. In clinical practice, inflammation provides a guide to potential targets for symp-tom management by signaling responsiveness to certain therapeutic strategies. For example, a theme across research with cytokine antagonists, omega-3 fatty acids, celecoxib, and exercise is that anti-inflammatory interventions have a sub-stantially greater impact on mood in individuals with height-ened inflammation. Thus, when inflammation and depression co-occur, treating them in tandem may enhance recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. The bidirectional links between depression, inflammation, and disease suggest that effective depression treatments could have a far-reaching impact on mood, inflammation, and health.},

Guidelines differ substantially in this regard. The authors conducted a diagnostic test meta-analysis using mostly individual patient data to assess whether lack of improvement at week 2 predicts later nonresponse. METHOD The search included EMBASE, MEDLINE, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and reference lists of relevant articles, supplemented by requests to authors of all relevant studies. The main outcome was prediction of nonresponse, defined as {\textless}50\% reduction in total score on either the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (corresponding to at least much improved) from baseline to endpoint (4-12 weeks), by {\textless}20\% PANSS or BPRS improvement (corresponding to less than minimally improved) at week 2. Secondary outcomes were absent cross-sectional symptomatic remission and {\textless}20\% PANSS or BPRS reduction at endpoint. Potential moderator variables were examined by meta-regression. RESULTS In 34 studies (N=9,460) a {\textless}20\% PANSS or BPRS reduction at week 2 predicted nonresponse at endpoint with a specificity of 86\% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 90\%. Using data for observed cases (specificity=86\%, PPV=85\%) or lack of remission (specificity=77\%, PPV=88\%) yielded similar results. Conversely, using the definition of {\textless}20\% reduction at endpoint yielded worse results (specificity=70\%, PPV=55\%). The test specificity was significantly moderated by a trial duration of {\textless}6 weeks, higher baseline illness severity, and shorter illness duration. CONCLUSIONS Patients not even minimally improved by week 2 of antipsychotic treatment are unlikely to respond later and may benefit from a treatment change.},

	abstract = {The major classes of psychotropic drugs were introduced in an extraordinary decade of discovery between the late 1940s and late 1950s. In the present climate of pessimism about the absence of new drug development, it may be instructive to look back at the research methods used during that era. The study that identified the first antidepressant is a case in point. It was conducted by Roland Kuhn, a Swiss psychiatrist working in a remote psychiatric hospital. Kuhn, like the other pioneering researchers of his day, was given access to new drug entities, and the method he used to discover their clinical effects was open-minded, exploratory, comprehensive, clinical observation. The paper that reported the results of his study has not been available in English, but because of its historical significance and because Kuhn's achievement stands in such contrast to the present impasse in drug development, the authors thought that it might be informative to read about his discovery in his own words. Accordingly, one of the authors (M.R.) translated the paper into English, and they now present excerpts of that translation with the intent of encouraging reevaluation of contemporary approaches to drug discovery. By today's clinical research standards, Kuhn's method of unfettered, exploratory, clinical observation was substandard, haphazard, even messy. Yet it produced a major breakthrough-the discovery that a drug can alleviate depression-that has had a lasting impact on the treatment of depression and on the development of antidepressant drugs. Kuhn's experience might usefully inform our strategies of drug development.},

Diabetes and prediabetes increased risk of conversion from amnestic MCI to Alzheimer's dementia; risk in treated versus untreated diabetes was lower in one study. Diabetes was also associated with increased risk of conversion from any-type or nonamnestic MCI to all-cause dementia. Metabolic syndrome and prediabetes predicted all-cause dementia in people with amnestic and any-type MCI, respectively. Mediterranean diet decreased the risk of conversion to Alzheimer's dementia.

Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included change in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes.Results:Ketamine (seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants) produced a rapid, yet transient, antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87 (4.37–22.29) and 14.47 (2.67–78.49), respectively, accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT (five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants) significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initial treatment (Hedges’ g=0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, d-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects.Conclusions:The antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, and perhaps D-cycloserine and rapastinel, holds promise for future glutamate-modulating strategies; however, the ineffectiveness of other NMDA antagonists suggests that any forthcoming advances will depend on improving our understanding of ketamine’s mechanism of action. The fleeting nature of ketamine’s therapeutic benefit, coupled with its potential for abuse and neurotoxicity, suggest that its use in the clinical setting warrants caution.},

Outcomes from mixed child and ado-lescent samples and from adolescent-only samples indicate that approximately two-thirds of youths respond favorably to CBT. CBT produces moderate to large effects and shows superiority over control/comparison conditions. The literature does not support differential outcomes by age: adolescents do not consistently manifest poorer outcomes relative to children. Although extinction paradigms find prolonged fear extinction in adolescent samples, basic research does not fully align with the processes and goals of real-life exposure. Furthermore, CBT is flexible and allows for tailored application in adoles-cents, and it may be delivered in alternative formats (i.e., brief, computer/Internet, school-based, and transdiagnostic CBT).},

	doi = {10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.14070918},
	abstract = {Objective: In this conceptual review, the authors propose a novel mechanistic candidate in the etiology of depression with onset in the menopause transition ("perimenopausal depression") involving alterations in stress-responsive pathways, induced by ovarian hormone fluctuation. Method: The relevant literature in perimenopausal depression, including prevalence, predictors, and treatment with estrogen therapy, was reviewed. Subsequently, the growing evidence from animal models and clinical research in other reproductive mood disorders was synthesized to describe a heuristic model of perimenopausal depression development. Results: The rate of major depressive disorder and clinically meaningful elevations in depressive symptoms increases two- to threefold during the menopause transition. While the mechanisms by which ovarian hormone fluctuation might impact mood are poorly understood, growing evidence from basic and clinical research suggests that fluctuations in ovarian hormones and derived neurosteroids result in alterations in regulation of the HPA axis by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The authors' heuristic model suggests that for some women, failure of the GABAA receptor to regulate overall GABA-ergic tone in the face of shifting levels of these neurosteroids may induce HPA axis dysfunction, thereby increasing sensitivity to stress and generating greater vulnerability to depression. Conclusions: The proposed model provides a basis for understanding the mechanisms by which the changing hormonal environment of the menopause transition may interact with the psychosocial environment of midlife to contribute to perimenopausal depression risk. Future research investigating this model may inform the development of novel pharmacological treatments for perimenopausal depression and related disorders, such as postpartum depression and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.},

	doi = {10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15020216},
	abstract = {Borderline personality disorder is characterized by three domains of dysfunction: affect dysregulation, behavioral dyscontrol, and interpersonal hypersensitivity. Interpersonal hypersensitivity is associated with a (pre)attentive bias toward negative social information and, on the level of the brain, enhanced bottom-up emotion generation, while affect dysregulation results from abnormal top-down processes. Additionally, the problems of patients with borderline personality disorder in interpersonal functioning appear to be related to alterations in the (social) reward and empathy networks. There is increasing evidence that the oxytocinergic system may be involved in these domains of dysfunction and may thus contribute to borderline psychopathology and even open new avenues for targeted pharmacotherapeutic approaches. From studies in healthy and clinical subjects (including first studies with borderline personality disorder patients), the authors provide a conceptual framework for future research in borderline personality disorder that is based on oxytocinergic modulation of the following biobehavioral mechanisms: 1) the brain salience network favoring adaptive social approach behavior, 2) the affect regulation circuit normalizing top-down processes, 3) the mesolimbic circuit improving social reward experiences, and 4) modulating brain regions involved in cognitive and emotional empathy. In addition, preliminary data point to interactions between the oxytocin and cannabinoid system, with implications for pain processing. These mechanisms,which the authors believe to be modulated by oxytocin, may not be specific for borderline personality disorder but rather may be common to a host of psychiatric disorders in which disturbed parent-infant attachment is a major etiological factor.

METHOD: In this critical review, the authors examine the extent to which multimodal neuroimaging techniques can identify biomarkers reflecting key pathophysiologic processes in depression and whether such biomarkers may act as predictors, moderators, and mediators of treatment response that might facilitate development of personalized treatments based on a better understanding of these processes. RESULTS: The authors first highlight the most consistent findings from neuroimaging studies using different techniques in depression, including structural and functional abnormalities in two parallel neural circuits: serotonergically modulated implicit emotion regulation circuitry, centered on the amygdala and different regions in the medial prefrontal cortex; and dopaminergically modulated reward neural circuitry, centered on the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. They then describe key findings from the relatively small number of studies indicating that specific measures of regional function and, to a lesser extent, structure in these neural circuits predict treatment response in depression. CONCLUSIONS: Limitations of existing studies include small sample sizes, use of only one neuroimaging modality, and a focus on identifying predictors rather than moderators and mediators of differential treatment response. By addressing these limitations and, most importantly, capitalizing on the benefits of multimodal neuroimaging, future studies can yield moderators and mediators of treatment response in depression to facilitate significant improvements in shorter- and longer-term clinical and functional outcomes.},

Childhood-onset anxiety disorders frequently persist into adulthood and place youths at risk for future psychiatric disorders, including mood and substance use disorders. Comorbidity is common in childhood anxiety disorders, and studies increasingly take this into account when assessing potential treatments. Existing studies support a number of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for childhood anxiety disorders. The strongest evidence supports use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Combination treatment with SSRIs and CBT has been found to be more effective than either treatment alone. Early detection and treatment of childhood anxiety disorders can prevent substantial impairment over the course of a child's development and accumulation of functional disability. Early treatment also may prevent later development of adult psychiatric illness.

METHOD The authors review the current state of the knowledge on cognitive training in psychiatric illnesses, and its neural and behavioral targets, and summarize the factors that appear to relate to a successful response, including learner characteristics that influence clinical outcome. They also discuss methodological issues relevant to the development and testing of cognitive training approaches, with the goal of creating maximally efficient and effective approaches to training. Finally, they identify gaps in existing knowledge and outline key research directions for the future. RESULTS While much of the early research has been conducted in schizophrenia, cognitive training has more recently been applied to a widening range of neuropsychiatric illnesses, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood disorders, and substance use disorders. Cognitive training harnesses the inherent neuroplastic capacities of the brain, targeting neural system function across psychiatric disorders, thus improving the cognitive processes that play a role in emotion regulation, clinical symptoms, and adaptive community functioning. CONCLUSIONS Cognitive training offers considerable promise, especially given the limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions in ameliorating cognitive deficits. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying cognitive training, predictors of response, generalization and real-world applicability, and approaches to dissemination in practice settings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Antidepressant drugs can cause drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The authors review clinical data relevant to antidepressant-induced liver injury and provide recommendations for clinical practice.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: A PubMed search was conducted for publications from 1965 onward related to antidepressant-induced liver injury. The search terms were "liver injury," "liver failure," "DILI," "hepatitis," "hepatotoxicity," "cholestasis," and "aminotransferase," cross-referenced with "antidepressant."{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Although data on antidepressant-induced liver injury are scarce, 0.5\%-3\% of patients treated with antidepressants may develop asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferase levels. All antidepressants can induce hepatotoxicity, especially in elderly patients and those with polypharmacy. Liver damage is in most cases idiosyncratic and unpredictable, and it is generally unrelated to drug dosage. The interval between treatment initiation and onset of liver injury is generally between several days and 6 months. Life-threatening antidepressant-induced liver injury has been described involving fulminant liver failure or death. The underlying lesions are often of the hepatocellular type and less frequently of the cholestatic and mixed types. The antidepressants associated with greater risks of hepatotoxicity are iproniazid, nefazodone, phenelzine, imipramine, amitriptyline, duloxetine, bupropion, trazodone, tianeptine, and agomelatine. The antidepressants that seem to have the least potential for hepatotoxicity are citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. Cross-toxicity has been described, mainly for tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Although an infrequent event, DILI from antidepressant drugs may be irreversible, and clinicians should be aware of it. Aminotransferase surveillance is the most useful tool for detecting DILI, and prompt discontinuation of the drug responsible is essential. The results of antidepressant liver toxicity in all phases of clinical trials should be available and published. Further research is needed before any new and rigorously founded recommendations can be made.},

The authors report what is to their knowledge the first large-scale collaborative study of rates and sex distributions of psychiatric disorders from childhood to adulthood in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The associations among psychopathology, intellect, and functioning were examined in a subgroup of participants. METHOD The 1,402 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, ages 6-68 years, were assessed for psychiatric disorders with validated diagnostic instruments. Data on intelligence and adaptive functioning were available for 183 participants ages 6 to 24 years. RESULTS Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the most frequent disorder in children (37.10\%) and was overrepresented in males. Anxiety disorders were more prevalent than mood disorders at all ages, but especially in children and adolescents. Anxiety and unipolar mood disorders were overrepresented in females. Psychotic disorders were present in 41\% of adults over age 25. Males did not predominate in psychotic or autism spectrum disorders. Hierarchical regressions in the subgroup revealed that daily living skills were predicted by the presence of anxiety disorders. Psychopathology was not associated with communication or socialization skills. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest study of psychiatric morbidity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It validates previous findings that this condition is one of the strongest risk factors for psychosis. Anxiety and developmental disorders were also prevalent. These results highlight the need to monitor and reduce the long-term burden of psychopathology in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.},

	abstract = {Clinically significant separation anxiety disorder in childhood leads to adult panic disorder and other anxiety disorders. The prevailing pathophysiological model of anxiety disorders, which emphasizes extinction deficits of fear-conditioned responses, does not fully consider the role of separation anxiety. Pathological early childhood attachments have far-reaching consequences for the later adult ability to experience and internalize positive relationships in order to develop mental capacities for self-soothing, anxiety tolerance, affect modulation, and individuation. Initially identified in attachment research, the phenomenon of separation anxiety is supported by animal model, neuroimaging, and genetic studies. A role of oxytocin is postulated. Adults, inured to their anxiety, often do not identify separation anxiety as problematic, but those who develop anxiety and mood disorders respond more poorly to both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. This poorer response may reflect patients’ difficulty in forming and maintaining attachments, including therapeutic relationships. Psychotherapies that focus on relationships and separation anxiety may benefit patients with separation anxiety by using the dyadic therapist-patient relationship to recapture and better understand important elements of earlier pathological parent-child relationships.},

They are relatively safe when used in medically controlled environments, with no reported risk of dependence. Here, we present a systematic review of published clinical treatment studies using psychedelics in patients with broadly defined UMD, and consider their place in psychiatry. Whilst all of the included studies have methodological shortcomings, of 423 individuals in 19 studies, 335 (79.2\%) showed clinician-judged improvement after treatment with psychedelics. A recently completed pilot study in the UK favours the use of psilocybin with psychological support in treatment resistant depressive disorder.

	abstract = {Rationale: In recent decades, the use of ayahuasca (AYA) – a β-carboline- and dimethyltryptamine-rich hallucinogenic botanical preparation traditionally used by Northwestern Amazonian tribes for ritual and therapeutic purposes – has spread from South America to Europe and the USA, raising concerns about its possible toxicity and hopes of its therapeutic potential. Thus, it is important to analyze the acute, subacute, and long-term effects of AYA to assess its safety and toxicity.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of human studies assessing AYA effects on psychiatric symptoms, neuropsychological functioning, and neuroimaging.Methods: Papers published until 16 December 2015 were included from PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and pre-determined set of criteria for article selection.Results: The review included 28 full-text articles. Acute AYA administration was well tolerated, increased introspection and positive mood, altered visual perceptions, activated frontal and paralimbic regions and decreased default mode network activity. It also improved planning and inhibitory control and impaired working memory, and showed antidepressive and antiaddictive potentials. Long-term AYA use was associated with increased cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex and cortical thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex, which was inversely correlated to age of onset, intensity of prior AYA use, and spirituality. Subacute and long-term AYA use was not associated with increased psychopathology or cognitive deficits, being associated with enhanced mood and cognition, increased spirituality, and reduced impulsivity.Conclusions: Acute, subacute, and long-term AYA use seems to have low toxicity. Preliminary studies about potential therapeutic effects of AYA need replication due to their methodological limitations.},

Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression.Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks.Results: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60–80\% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression.Conclusions: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00957359},

Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80\% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with {\textgreater}80\% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction.

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) assessed using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experience (CAPE) questionnaire and the pattern of cannabis use in a non-clinical sample collected by snowball sampling.Methods: Our sample was composed of 204 subjects, distributed into three groups by their cannabis use pattern: 68 were non-cannabis users, 40 were moderate cannabis users and 96 were daily cannabis users. We assessed the psychotic experiences in each group with the CAPE questionnaire; and then controlled for the effect of possible confounding factors like sex, age, social exclusion, age of onset of cannabis use, alcohol use and other drug use.Results: We found a significant quadratic association between the frequency of cannabis use and positive (β = −1.8; p = 0.004) and negative dimension scores (β = −1.2; p = 0.04). The first-rank and mania factors showed a significant quadratic association (p {\textless} 0.05), while the voices factor showed a trend (p = 0.07). Scores for the different groups tended to maintain a U-shape in their values for the different factors. When we adjusted for gender, age, social exclusion, age of onset of cannabis use, and use of alcohol and other drugs, only the first-rank experiences remained significant.Conclusions: We found there was a U-shaped curve in the association between cannabis use and the positive and negative dimensions of the CAPE score. We also found this association in mania and first-rank experiences.},

	abstract = {Recreational use of mephedrone, alone and in combination with alcohol, has increased over the past years. Pharmacological properties of mephedrone share similarities with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but its effect on neurocognitive function has not been well established in humans. The present study assessed the effect of mephedrone alone and after co-administration with alcohol on neurocognitive function. It was hypothesised that mephedrone would improve psychomotor performance but impair memory performance, when administered alone. Neurocognitive performance was expected to be impaired following mephedrone when combined with alcohol. Eleven participants received single doses of 200 mg mephedrone or placebo combined with 0.8 g/kg alcohol or placebo. Neurocognitive performance was assessed at baseline (T0), at one hour (T1) and four hours after (T2) mephedrone administration, by means of the Divided Attention Task (DAT), Critical Tracking Task (CTT), and the Spatial Memory Test (SMT). Mephedrone intoxication impaired short-term spatial memory at T1 and improved critical tracking performance at T2. Mephedrone alone did not affect divided attention, but did show an interaction with alcohol on reaction time at T2. Reaction time decreased when mephedrone was combined with alcohol as compared to alcohol alone. Alcohol intoxication impaired both short- and long-term spatial memory at T1 and divided attention at T1 and T2. Critical tracking performance was not affected by alcohol intoxication. The current findings support the hypothesis that mephedrone improves psychomotor performance, impairs spatial memory and does not affect divided attention performance. Stimulatory effects of mephedrone were not sufficient to compensate for the impairing effects of alcohol on most performance parameters.},

Placebo theory is aimed at medical professionals; set and setting theory is aimed at professionals and drug users alike. Placebo theory is primarily descriptive, describing how placebo acts; set and setting theory is primarily prescriptive, educating therapists and users on how to control and optimize the effects of drugs.

Traditionally conceived as an 'at risk' state for the development of psychotic disorders, it is also conceptualised as a clinical syndrome associated with functional impairment. Aims To investigate meta-analytically the functional status of patients at high clinical risk for psychosis and its association with longitudinal outcomes. Method Three meta-analyses compared level of functioning (n = 3012) and quality of life (QoL) (n = 945) between a high-risk group, a healthy control group and group with psychosis, and baseline functioning in people in the high-risk group who did or did not have a transition to psychosis at follow-up (n = 654). Results People at high risk had a large impairment in functioning (P{\textless}0.001) and worse QoL (P = 0.001) than the healthy control group, but only small to moderately better functioning (P = 0.012) and similar QoL (P = 0.958) compared with the psychosis group. Among the high-risk group, those who did not develop psychosis reported better functioning (P = 0.001) than those who did. Conclusions Our results indicate that the high-risk state is characterised by consistent and large impairments of functioning and reduction in QoL similar to those in other coded psychiatric disorders.},

METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomised controlled trials was conducted. RESULTS: One case-control study, ten cross-sectional studies and three cohort studies with a total of 31 424 participants were analysed. Lower vitamin D levels were found in people with depression compared with controls (SMD = 0.60, 95\% CI 0.23-0.97) and there was an increased odds ratio of depression for the lowest v. highest vitamin D categories in the cross-sectional studies (OR = 1.31, 95\% CI 1.0-1.71). The cohort studies showed a significantly increased hazard ratio of depression for the lowest v. highest vitamin D categories (HR = 2.21, 95\% CI 1.40-3.49).

AIMS: To examine evidence related to efficacy, tolerability and safety of antidepressants for people with depression and with chronic physical health problems. METHOD: Meta-analyses of randomised controlled efficacy trials of antidepressants in depression in chronic physical health conditions. Systematic review of safety studies. RESULTS: Sixty-three studies met inclusion criteria (5794 participants). In placebo-controlled studies, antidepressants showed a significant advantage in respect to remission and/or response: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) risk ratio (RR) = 0.81 (95\% CI 0.73-0.91) for remission, RR = 0.83 (95\% CI 0.71-0.97) for response; tricyclics RR = 0.70 (95\% CI 0.40-1.25 (not significant)) for remission, RR = 0.55 (95\% 0.43-0.70) for response. Both groups of drugs were less well tolerated than placebo (leaving study early due to adverse effects) for SSRIs RR = 1.80 (95\% CI 1.16-2.78), for tricyclics RR = 2.00 (95\% CI 0.99-3.57). Only SSRIs were shown to improve quality of life. Direct comparisons of SSRIs and tricyclics revealed no advantage for either group for remission, response, effect size or tolerability. Effectiveness studies suggest a neutral or beneficial effect on mortality for antidepressants in participants with recent myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressants are efficacious and safe in the treatment of depression occurring in the context of chronic physical health problems. The SSRIs are probably the antidepressants of first choice given their demonstrable effect on quality of life and their apparent safety in cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {In this letter, the author describes how some of the features of Skype, and video conferencing more generally, offer a unique opportunity to address therapeutically a fundamental component of the narcissistic disturbances. Skype and similar video conferencing technologies present opportunities to explore empathy, connection, attunement and their vicissitudes. In traditional therapy, empathic failures that inevitably arose over the course of treatment – the therapist being late or not responding to a comment in an empathic way tended to be addressed as they materialized. However, the intrinsic features of video conferencing such as connection strength, the complexities involved with consistently achieving direct eye contact, not infrequent problems with audio and visual components resulting in less than optimal images, missed words and delays together create empathic failures and misattunements in the relational field and thrust such issues, particularly disconnects, to the forefront of treatment. Early in treatment, such Skype associated empathic divergences need to be addressed at a manifest level such that a complaint about sound quality should result in a collaborative attempt to remedy the audio issue. In this way, a progressive approach involving early responsiveness to, and later further discussion of, technologically facilitated empathic mismatches can help necessary work on patients' underlying narcissistic issues.

Method The review process involved a systematic literature search of 20 electronic databases, eligibility screening of results, data extraction, quality appraisal and data synthesis. Results A total of 38 relevant studies were identified. The strongest impact of training appears to be on de-escalation-related knowledge, confidence to manage aggression and deescalation performance (although limited to artificial training scenarios). No strong conclusions could be drawn about the impact of training on assaults, injuries, containment and organisational outcomes owing to the low quality of evidence and conflicting results. Conclusions It is assumed that de-escalation techniques training will improve staff's ability to de-escalate violent and aggressive behaviour and improve safety in practice.

	doi = {10.1192/bjp.bp.115.173450},
	abstract = {Introduction: Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders, with a twelve-month prevalence of 18.1\% in the US. Second-generation antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are considered first-line treatments for anxiety. Recent studies in major depressive disorder have suggested that antidepressants are more effective for severely depressed patients than for mildly depressed patients [1,2]. As a consequence, guidelines for the treatment of milder depression have changed. Little is known, however, about whether this relationship between baseline severity and antidepressant efficacy also holds for anxiety disorders. Objective: To examine the influence of baseline severity of anxiety on antidepressant efficacy for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder (PD). Methods: Data from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews of approved second-generation antidepressants was used. All premarketing randomized controlled trials of secondgeneration antidepressants for the short-term treatment of an anxiety disorder were included, with the exception of three trials with incompatible primary outcomes. Baseline symptom scores and change in symptom scores were extracted for placebo and treatment groups in each study. For PD, remission rates were also extracted. Hedges' g was calculated from the change score and its standard deviation for GAD, SAD, OCD, and PTSD. For 10 trials, data on the standard deviation or remission rate was missing; multiple imputation was used to impute these missing data. Mixed-effects meta-regression was used to investigate the effects of treatment group, baseline severity, and their interaction on the standardized change from baseline or the remission rate (for PD only). Results: Fifty-six trials with a total of 14,710 participants were included. Placebo effect sizes ranged from 0.49 for OCD to 1.03 for GAD, while drug effect sizes ranged from 0.83 for OCD to 1.35 for GAD. Increasing baseline severity did not predict greater improvement in drug groups compared to placebo groups. Standardized regression coefficients of the interaction term between baseline severity and treatment group were 0.04 (95\% confidence interval -0.13 to 0.20, p = 0.65) for GAD, -0.06 (-0.20 to 0.09, p = 0.43) for SAD, 0.04 (-0.07 to 0.16, p = 0.46) for OCD, 0.16 (-0.22 to 0.53, p = 0.37) for PTSD, and 0.002 (-0.10 to 0.10, p = 0.96) for PD. For OCD, baseline severity did predict improvement in both placebo and drug groups equally (b = 0.11, 95\% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.17, p = 0.001). Conclusions: No relationship between baseline severity and the drug-placebo difference was found for anxiety disorders. These results suggest that mildly or moderately anxious patients may experience as much benefit from antidepressants as severely anxious patients. The size of the drug-placebo difference was small to moderate; whether these effects may be considered clinically relevant remains a matter of debate. If considered clinically relevant, however, our results suggest that antidepressants may be prescribed to anxious patients regardless of symptom severity.},

The relationship between autoimmunity and primary obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), however, is less clear.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAIMS: To pool data on serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anti-basal ganglia antibody (ABGA) positivity in primary OCD (without neurological or autoimmune comorbidity) relative to controls or neuropsychiatric disorders previously associated with increased odds of ABGA positivity.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: We performed electronic database and hand-searches for studies meeting pre-specified eligibility criteria from which we extracted data using a standardised form. We calculated pooled estimates of ABGA positivity using a random-effects model.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Seven case-control studies totalling 844 participants met the eligibility criteria. Meta-analysis showed that a significantly greater proportion of those with primary OCD were ABGA seropositive compared with various controls (odds ratio (OR) = 4.97, 95\% CI 2.88-8.55, P{\textless}0.00001). This effect was not associated with heterogeneity or publication bias, and remained significant after stratifying the analysis by age, gender, disease severity, illness duration, immunostaining methodology, study quality, publication type, kind of control group, and sample size. There were no significant differences in ABGA seropositivity for comparisons between primary OCD and Tourette syndrome, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: of one study testing CSF samples showed that a significantly greater proportion of participants with primary OCD were ABGA CSF-positive compared with healthy controls (OR = 5.60, 95\% CI 1.04-30.20, P = 0.045).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Odds of ABGA seropositivity are increased fivefold in primary OCD compared with controls, but are comparable to those associated with disorders previously associated with ABGA, providing circumstantial evidence of autoimmunity in a subset of those with primary OCD.

Aims To compare the oral health of people with severe mental illness with that of the general population. Method A systematic search for studies from the past 20 years was conducted using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase and article bibliographies. Papers were independently assessed. The primary outcome was total tooth loss (edentulousness), the end-stage of both untreated caries and periodontal disease. We also assessed dental decay through standardised measures: the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) or surfaces (DMFS). For studies lacking a control group we used controls of similar ages from a community survey within 10 years of the study. Results We identified 21 papers of which 14 had sufficient data (n = 2784 psychiatric patients) and suitable controls (n = 31 084) for a random effects meta-analysis. People with severe mental illness had 3.4 times the odds of having lost all their teeth than the general community (95\% CI 1.6-7.2).

Method A systematic search was made of Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE and article bibliographies. Outcomes were dental erosion, salivary gland function and the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth or surfaces (DMFT/S). Results Ten studies had sufficient data for a random effects metaanalysis (psychiatric patients n = 556, controls n = 556). Patients with an eating disorder had five times the odds of dental erosion compared with controls (95\% CI 3.31-7.58); odds were highest in those with self-induced vomiting (odds ratio (OR) = 7.32). Patients also had significantly higher DMFS scores (mean difference 3.07, 95\% CI 0.66-5.48) and reduced salivary flow (OR = 2.24, 95\% CI 1.44-3.51). Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of collaboration between dental and medical practitioners. Dentists may be the first clinicians to suspect an eating disorder given patients' reluctance to present for psychiatric treatment, whereas mental health clinicians should be aware of the oral consequences of inappropriate diet, psychotropic medication and self-induced vomiting.},

Twenty-three studies (278 patients and 265 controls) were identified. Clinicodemographic and imaging variables were extracted and effect sizes determined for the dopaminergic measures. There were sufficient data to permit meta-analyses for the temporal cortex, thalamus and substantia nigra but not for other regions.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: The meta-analysis of dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability found summary effect sizes of d = -0.32 (95\% CI -0.68 to 0.03) for the thalamus, d = -0.23 (95\% CI -0.54 to 0.07) for the temporal cortex and d = 0.04 (95\% CI -0.92 to 0.99) for the substantia nigra.

METHOD: We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 studies comparing a psychological treatment of subclinical depression with a control group. RESULTS: The target groups, therapies and characteristics of the included studies differed considerably from each other, and the quality of many studies was not optimal. Psychotherapies did have a small to moderate effect on depressive symptoms against care as usual at the post-test assessment (g = 0.35, 95\% CI 0.23-0.47; NNT = 5, 95\% CI 4-8) and significantly reduced the incidence of major depressive episodes at 6 months (RR = 0.61) and possibly at 12 months (RR = 0.74). The effects were significantly smaller than those of psychotherapy for major depressive disorder and could be accounted for by non-specific effects of treatment.

The aim of the study was to determine systematically and transparently the full spectrum of ethical issues in ALS care. We conducted a systematic review in Medline and Google Books (restricted to English and German literature published between 1993 and 2014). We applied qualitative text analysis and normative analysis to categorise the spectrum of ethical issues in ALS care. The literature review retrieved 56 references that together mentioned a spectrum of 103 ethical issues in ALS care. The spectrum was structured into six major categories that consist of first and second-order categories of ethical issues. The systematically derived spectrum of ethical issues in ALS care presented in this paper raises awareness and understanding of the complexity of ethical issues in ALS care. It also offers a basis for the systematic development of informational and training materials for health professionals, patients and their relatives, and society as a whole. Finally, it supports a rational and fair selection of all those ethical issues that should be addressed in health policies, position papers and clinical practice guidelines. Further research is needed to identify ways to systematically select the most relevant ethical issues not only in the clinical environment, but also for the development of clinical practice guidelines. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Aims: To synthesise published findings for treatment with SIH for refractory heroin-dependence through systematic review and meta-analysis, and to examine the political and scientific response to these findings. Method: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of SIH treatment were identified through database searching, and random effects pooled efficacy was estimated for SIH treatment. Methodological quality was assessed according to criteria set out by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Across the trials, SIH treatment improved treatment outcome, i.e. greater reduction in the use of illicit 'street' heroin in patients receiving SIH treatment compared with control groups (most often receiving MMT). Conclusions: SIH is found to be an effective way of treating heroin dependence refractory to standard treatment. SIH may be less safe than MMT and therefore requires more clinical attention to manage greater safety issues. This intensive intervention is for a patient population previously considered unresponsive to treatment.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that has included studies evaluating this risk specifically in people with bipolar disorder.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Fifty-one studies were included. Most of the studies found an increased risk for developing dementia in individuals with depression. Greater frequency and severity of depressive episodes seem to increase this risk. The evidence is contradictory regarding whether there is a difference in risk in people with early- or late-onset depression. The few available risk estimates for dementia in people with bipolar disorder suggest an even higher risk than for those with depression.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Affective disorders appear to be associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, and one that is dependent on clinical and demographic variables. Depression may be both a prodrome and a risk factor for dementia. Future research should aim to elucidate the mechanisms that mediate these links.},

	abstract = {Background It has been suggested that the efficacy of antidepressants has been overestimated in clinical trials owing to unblinding of drug treatments by adverse events. Aims To investigate the association between adverse events and the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Method The literature was searched to identify randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials of SSRIs in the treatment of major depression. Efficacy outcomes were response to treatment and change in depressive symptoms. Reporting of adverse events was used as an indicator of tolerability. Random effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled estimates. Meta-regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between adverse events and efficacy. Potential mediation was investigated with the Baron \& Kenny approach. Results A total of 68 trials (n = 17 646) were included in the analyses. In meta-analysis SSRIs were superior to placebo in terms of efficacy (odds ratio, OR = 1.62, 95\% CI 1.51-1.72). More patients allocated to SSRIs reported adverse events than did patients receiving placebo (OR = 1.73, 95\% CI 1.58-1.89). Meta-regression analyses did not find an association between adverse events and efficacy (P = 0.439). There was no indication of adverse events mediating the effect of SSRI treatment. Conclusions Our results do not support, but also do not unequivocally disprove, the hypothesis that adverse events lead to an overestimation of the effect of SSRIs over placebo.},

Moderate-quality evidence associated individual psychological interventions with reduced relapses at post-treatment (risk ratio (RR) = 0.66, 95\% CI 0.48–0.92) and follow-up (RR = 0.74, 95\% CI 0.63–0.87), and collaborative care with a reduction in hospital admissions (RR = 0.68, 95\% CI 0.49–0.94). Low-quality evidence associated group interventions with fewer depression relapses at post-treatment and follow-up, and family psychoeducation with reduced symptoms of depression and mania.

Method: Systematic review and evidence synthesis (PROSPERO registration: CRD42011001661). Data sources included the published and the 'grey' literature. A survey of experts and a consultation with patients and carers all contributed to the evidence synthesis, interpretation and recommendations. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in our analysis. The trials showed benefits mainly for depressive symptoms, experiences of care, knowledge, stigma, adherence to prescribed medication, insight and alliance. The effect sizes were smaller for better-quality trials (range of d 0.18-0.75) than for moderate- or lower-quality studies (range of d 0.18-4.3). The review found only two studies offering weak economic evidence. Conclusions: Culturally adapted psychotherapies, and ethnographic and motivational assessment leading to psychotherapies were effective and favoured by patients and carers.

	abstract = {Background: The value of drug interviews in the treatment of conversion disorder is at present unknown. Aims: To review all the available papers published in English that report on the use of drug interviews for treating conversion/dissociative disorder. Method: Databases (including EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) were searched from 1920 to 2009. Selected publications had to report on the use of drug interviews in people diagnosed with a conversion/dissociative disorder. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted. Predictors of a positive response were ascertained using meta-analytic techniques. Results: Fifty-five papers meeting inclusion criteria were identified. No studies compared the intervention with a suitable control group. However, two studies reported high response rates when drug interview was used in individuals with treatment-resistant conversion disorder. In the meta-analysis, the use of suggestion and occurrence of emotional catharsis during the interview were positively associated with recovery. Combining two medications and comorbid psychiatric disorder were negatively associated with recovery. Conclusions: The evidence for effectiveness of drug interviews is of poor quality but it may be of benefit in the treatment of acute and treatment-resistant conversion disorder. A proactive approach during the interview, making suggestions the individual will respond, could influence outcome. Comorbid psychiatric disorder should be treated conventionally. Experimental studies to determine efficacy are required. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

AIMS To investigate whether biogenetic causal attributions of mental illness among the general public are associated with more tolerant attitudes, whether such attributions are related to lower perceptions of guilt and responsibility, to what extent notions of responsibility are associated with rejection of people who are mentally ill, and how prevalent notions of responsibility are among the general public with regard to different mental disorders. METHOD A systematic review was conducted of representative population studies examining attitudes towards people with mental illness and beliefs about such disorders. RESULTS We identified 33 studies relevant to this review. Generally, biogenetic causal attributions were not associated with more tolerant attitudes; they were related to stronger rejection in most studies examining schizophrenia. No published study reported on associations of biogenetic causal attributions and perceived responsibility. The stereotype of self-responsibility was unrelated to rejection in most studies. Public images of mental disorder are generally dominated by the stereotypes of unpredictability and dangerousness, whereas responsibility is less relevant.

Method: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of newer-generation antidepressants and CBT in adolescent depression. Results: There was no evidence of a statistically significant benefit of combined treatment over antidepressants for depressive symptoms, suicidality and global improvement after acute treatment or at follow-up. There was a statistically significant advantage of combined treatment for impairment in the short-term (at 12 weeks) only. There was some evidence of heterogeneity between studies. Conclusions: Adding CBT to antidepressants confers limited advantage for the treatment of an episode of depression in adolescents. The variation in sampling and methodology between studies, as well as the small number of trials, limits the generalisability of the findings and any conclusions that can be drawn. Future studies should examine predictors of response to treatment as well as clinical components that may affect outcome.

Its ability to be generalised to other countries and its effectiveness in varying economic conditions remains to be ascertained. Aims To investigate whether IPS is effective across international settings and in different economic conditions. Method A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing IPS with traditional vocational services was undertaken; 17 studies, as well as 2 follow-up studies, were included. Meta-regressions were carried out to examine whether IPS effectiveness varied according to geographic location, unemployment rates or gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Results The overall pooled risk ratio for competitive employment using IPS compared with traditional vocational rehabilitation was 2.40 (95\% CI 1.99–2.90). Meta-regressions indicated that neither geographic area nor unemployment rates affected the overall effectiveness of IPS. Even when a country’s GDP growth was less than 2\% IPS was significantly more effective than traditional vocational training, and its benefits remained evident over 2 years. Conclusions Individual placement and support is an effective intervention across a variety of settings and economic conditions and is more than twice as likely to lead to competitive employment when compared with traditional vocational rehabilitation.},

A synopsis of such models might help to guide further research and improve therapeutic interventions.{\textbackslash}nAims{\textbackslash}nTo conduct a conceptual review of resource-oriented therapeutic models in psychiatry, in order to identify their shared characteristics.{\textbackslash}nMethod{\textbackslash}nThe literature was searched to identify a range of resource-oriented therapeutic models, particularly for patients with severe mental illness. Key texts for each model were analysed using a narrative approach to synthesise the concepts and their characteristics.{\textbackslash}nResults{\textbackslash}nTen models were included: befriending, client-centred therapy, creative music therapy, open dialogue, peer support workers, positive psychotherapy, self-help groups, solution-focused therapy, systemic family therapy and therapeutic communities. Six types of resources were utilised: social relationships, patients’ decision-making ability, experiential knowledge, patients’ individual strengths, recreational activities and self-actualising tendencies. Social relationships are a key resource in all the models, including relationships with professionals, peers, friends and family. Two relationship dimensions - reciprocity and expertise - differed across the models.{\textbackslash}nConclusions{\textbackslash}nThe review suggests that a range of different therapeutic models in psychiatry address resources rather than deficits. In various ways, they all utilise social relationships to induce therapeutic change. A better understanding of how social relationships affect mental health may inform the development and application of resource-oriented approaches.},

However, this view is based mainly on meta-analysis, whose findings can be influenced by failure to consider sources of bias. AIMS: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of CBT for schizophrenic symptoms that includes an examination of potential sources of bias. METHOD: Data were pooled from randomised trials providing end-of-study data on overall, positive and negative symptoms. The moderating effects of randomisation, masking of outcome assessments, incompleteness of outcome data and use of a control intervention were examined. Publication bias was also investigated. RESULTS: Pooled effect sizes were -0.33 (95\% CI -0.47 to -0.19) in 34 studies of overall symptoms, -0.25 (95\% CI -0.37 to -0.13) in 33 studies of positive symptoms and -0.13 (95\% CI -0.25 to -0.01) in 34 studies of negative symptoms. Masking significantly moderated effect size in the meta-analyses of overall symptoms (effect sizes -0.62 (95\% CI -0.88 to -0.35) v. -0.15 (95\% CI -0.27 to -0.03), P = 0.001) and positive symptoms (effect sizes -0.57 (95\% CI -0.76 to -0.39) v. -0.08 (95\% CI -0.18 to 0.03), P{\textless}0.001). Use of a control intervention did not moderate effect size in any of the analyses. There was no consistent evidence of publication bias across different analyses.

AIMS To review systematically the evidence of efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant and benzodiazepine treatments for patients with minor depression. METHOD A systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing antidepressants or benzodiazepines v. placebo in adults with minor depression. Data were obtained from MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and pharmaceutical company websites. Risk of bias was assessed for the generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, masking, incomplete outcome data, and sponsorship bias. RESULTS Six studies met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared paroxetine with placebo; fluoxetine, amitriptyline and isocarboxazid were studied in one study each. No studies compared benzodiazepines with placebo. In terms of failures to respond to treatment (6 studies, 234 patients treated with antidepressants and 234 with placebo) no significant difference between antidepressants and placebo was found (relative risk (RR) 0.94, 95\% CI 0.81-1.08). In terms of acceptability, data extracted from two studies (93 patients treated with antidepressants and 93 with placebo) showed no statistically significant difference between antidepressants and placebo (RR=1.06, 95\% CI 0.65-1.73).

Support interventions had a beneficial effect on psychological distress at the end of the intervention (SMD = -0.99, 95\% CI -1.48 to -0.49) as did problem-solving bibliotherapy (SMD = -1.57, 95\% CI -1.79 to -1.35); these effects were maintained at follow-up. The quality of the evidence was mainly low and very low. Evidence for combining these interventions and for self-help and self-management was inconclusive. Conclusions: Carer-focused interventions appear to improve the experience of caring and quality of life and reduce psychological distress of those caring for people with severe mental illness, and these benefits may be gained in first-episode psychosis. Interventions for carers should be considered as part of integrated services for people with severe mental health problems.},

Method We reviewed 41 studies fitting predetermined criteria, assessed validity using a checklist, calculated standardised outcomes and prioritised primary outcome findings in placebo-controlled studies. Results The strongest evidence was that cholinesterase inhibitors did not reduce incident dementia. Cognition improved in single trials of: a heterogeneous psychological group intervention over 6 months; piribedil, a dopamine agonist over 3 months; and donepezil over 48 weeks. Nicotine improved attention over 6 months. There was equivocal evidence that Huannao Yicong improved cognition and social functioning. Conclusions There was no replicated evidence that any intervention was effective. Cholinesterase inhibitors and rofecoxib are ineffective in preventing dementia. Further good-quality RCTs are needed and preliminary evidence suggests these should include trials of psychological group interventions and piribedil.},

RESULTS: In total 98 data-sets were included in the BPRS analysis and 202 data-sets in the PANSS analysis. When aggregated scores were translated into notional CGI-C scores, most drugs reached 'minimal improvement' on the BPRS, but few reached that level for PANSS. This was true of both first- and second-generation drugs, including clozapine. Amisulpride and olanzapine had better than average CGI-C scores.

METHOD: Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis with a minimum of three independent studies to warrant pooling by drug class. RESULTS: We found 61 comparative analyses (from 23 publications) relating to the prescription of 12 classes of medication for cardiovascular health, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis and HIV in a total sample of 1 931 509 people. In those with severe mental illness the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for an equitable prescription was 0.74 (95\% CI 0.63-0.86), with lower than expected prescriptions for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE/ARBs), beta-blockers and statins. People with affective disorder had an odds ratio of 0.75 (95\% CI 0.55-1.02) but this was not significant. Individuals with a history of other (miscellaneous) mental illness had an odds ratio of 0.95 (95\% CI 0.92-0.98) of comparable medication with lower receipt of ACE/ARBs but not highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medication. Results were significant in both adjusted and unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with severe mental illness (including schizophrenia) appear to be prescribed significantly lower quantities of several common medications for medical disorders, largely for cardiovascular indications, although further work is required to clarify to what extent this is because of prescriber intent.},

Investigations into this hypothesis have resulted in a complex and sometimes disparate literature.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAIMS: To systematically identify relevant studies, summarise their findings and discuss potential explanations of the associations found between ethnic density and mental disorders.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: A narrative review of studies published up to January 2011, identified through a systematic search strategy. Studies included have a defined ethnic minority sample; some measure of ethnic density defined at a geographical scale smaller than a nation or a US state; and a measure ascertaining mental health or disorder.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: A total of 34 papers from 29 data-sets were identified. Protective associations between ethnic density and diagnosis of mental disorders were most consistent in older US ecological studies of admission rates. Among more recent multilevel studies, there was some evidence of ethnic density being protective against depression and anxiety for African American people and Hispanic adults in the USA. However, Hispanic, Asian-American and Canadian 'visible minority' adolescents have higher levels of depression at higher ethnic densities. Studies in the UK showed mixed results, with evidence for protective associations most consistent for psychoses.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The most consistent associations with ethnic density are found for psychoses. Ethnic density may also protect against other mental disorders, but presently, as most studies of ethnic density have limited statistical power, and given the heterogeneity of their study designs, our conclusions can only be tentative.},

AIMS: The present study systematically reviewed published and unpublished evidence of the acute and long-term efficacy and acceptability of agomelatine compared with placebo in the treatment of major depression. METHOD: Randomised controlled trials comparing agomelatine with placebo in the treatment of unipolar major depression were systematically reviewed. Primary outcomes were (a) Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) score at the end of treatment (short-term studies) and (b) number of relapses (long-term studies). RESULTS: Meta-analyses included 10 acute-phase and 3 relapse prevention studies. Seven of the included studies were unpublished. Acute treatment with agomelatine was associated with a statistically significant superiority over placebo of -1.51 HRSD points (99\% CI -2.29 to -0.73, nine studies). Data extracted from three relapse prevention studies failed to show significant effects of agomelatine over placebo (relative risk 0.78, 99\% CI 0.41-1.48). Secondary efficacy analyses showed a significant advantage of agomelatine over placebo in terms of response (with no effect for remission). None of the negative trials were published and conflicting results between published and unpublished studies were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence suggesting that a clinically important difference between agomelatine and placebo in patients with unipolar major depression is unlikely.

Guidelines and policy documents recommend that shared decision-making should be implemented, yet whether it leads to greater treatment-related empowerment for this group has not been systematically assessed. AIMS To examine the effects of shared decision-making on indices of treatment-related empowerment of people with psychosis. METHOD We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of shared decision-making concerning current or future treatment for psychosis (PROSPERO registration CRD42013006161). Primary outcomes were indices of treatment-related empowerment and objective coercion (compulsory treatment). Secondary outcomes were treatment decision-making ability and the quality of the therapeutic relationship. RESULTS We identified 11 RCTs. Small beneficial effects of increased shared decision-making were found on indices of treatment-related empowerment (6 RCTs; g = 0.30, 95\% CI 0.09-0.51), although the effect was smaller if trials with {\textgreater}25\% missing data were excluded. There was a trend towards shared decision-making for future care leading to reduced use of compulsory treatment over 15-18 months (3 RCTs; RR = 0.59, 95\% CI 0.35-1.02), with a number needed to treat of approximately 10 (95\% CI 5-∞). No clear effect on treatment decision-making ability (3 RCTs) or the quality of the therapeutic relationship (8 RCTs) was found, but data were heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS For people with psychosis the implementation of shared treatment decision-making appears to have small beneficial effects on indices of treatment-related empowerment, but more direct evidence is required.},

AIMS: To investigate the comparative efficacy of these agents on cognition and symptoms in schizophrenia, and to identify promising cognitive domains and candidate medications that can be incorporated in treatment trials combined with cognitive remediation to maximise treatment effects. METHOD: A total of 26 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies investigating medications targeted at cholinergic, glutamatergic or serotonergic receptor classes and with participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were identified. RESULTS: Medications targeted at the cholinergic receptor class produced marginal improvements in verbal learning and memory (d = 0.23, P = 0.06), and donepezil, a specific type of cholinergic agonist, produced a moderate effect (d = 0.58) on spatial learning and memory.

For individual pharmacological agents compared with placebo in two or more trials, we found small statistically significant evidence of efficacy for fluoxetine, paroxetine and venlafaxine. Conclusions: Some drugs have a small positive impact on PTSD symptoms and are acceptable. Fluoxetine, paroxetine and venlafaxine may be considered as potential treatments for the disorder.

Aims To measure the association between abortion and indicators of adverse mental health, with subgroup effects calculated based on comparison groups (no abortion, unintended pregnancy delivered, pregnancy delivered) and particular outcomes. A secondary objective was to calculate population-attributable risk (PAR) statistics for each outcome. Method After the application of methodologically based selection criteria and extraction rules to minimise bias, the sample comprised 22 studies, 36 measures of effect and 877 181 participants (163 831 experienced an abortion). Random effects pooled odds ratios were computed using adjusted odds ratios from the original studies and PAR statistics were derived from the pooled odds ratios. Results Women who had undergone an abortion experienced an 81\% increased risk of mental health problems, and nearly 10\% of the incidence of mental health problems was shown to be attributable to abortion. The strongest subgroup estimates of increased risk occurred when abortion was compared with term pregnancy and when the outcomes pertained to substance use and suicidal behaviour. Conclusions This review offers the largest quantitative estimate of mental health risks associated with abortion available in the world literature. Calling into question the conclusions from traditional reviews, the results revealed a moderate to highly increased risk of mental health problems after abortion. Consistent with the tenets of evidence-based medicine, this information should inform the delivery of abortion services.},

Aims To synthesise the evidence regarding the effectiveness of brief contact interventions for reducing self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide. Method A systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted of randomised controlled trials using brief contact interventions (telephone contacts; emergency or crisis cards; and postcard or letter contacts). Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine study quality and subgroup effects. Results We found 14 eligible studies overall, of which 12 were amenable to meta-analyses. For any subsequent episode of self-harm or suicide attempt, there was a non-significant reduction in the overall pooled odds ratio (OR) of 0.87 (95\% CI 0.74-1.04, P = 0119) for intervention compared with control. The number of repetitions per person was significantly reduced in intervention v. control (incidence rate ratio IRR = 066, 95\% CI 0.54-0.80, P{\textless}0001). There was no significant reduction in the odds of suicide in intervention compared with control (OR = 0.58, 95\% CI 0.24-1.38). Conclusions A non-significant positive effect on repeated self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide and a significant effect on the number of episodes of repeated self-harm or suicide attempts per person (based on only three studies) means that brief contact interventions cannot yet be recommended for widespread clinical implementation. We recommend further assessment of possible benefits in well-designed trials in clinical populations.},

	abstract = {BackgroundMost research on interventions to counter stigma and discrimination has focused on short-term outcomes and has been conducted in high-income settings.AimsTo synthesise what is known globally about effective interventions to reduce mental illness-based stigma and discrimination, in relation first to effectiveness in the medium and long term (minimum 4 weeks), and second to interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).MethodWe searched six databases from 1980 to 2013 and conducted a multi-language Google search for quantitative studies addressing the research questions. Effect sizes were calculated from eligible studies where possible, and narrative syntheses conducted. Subgroup analysis compared interventions with and without social contact.ResultsEighty studies (n = 422 653) were included in the review. For studies with medium or long-term follow-up (72, of which 21 had calculable effect sizes) median standardised mean differences were 0.54 for knowledge and −0.26 for stigmatising attitudes. Those containing social contact (direct or indirect) were not more effective than those without. The 11 LMIC studies were all from middle-income countries. Effect sizes were rarely calculable for behavioural outcomes or in LMIC studies.ConclusionsThere is modest evidence for the effectiveness of anti-stigma interventions beyond 4 weeks follow-up in terms of increasing knowledge and reducing stigmatising attitudes. Evidence does not support the view that social contact is the more effective type of intervention for improving attitudes in the medium to long term. Methodologically strong research is needed on which to base decisions on investment in stigma-reducing interventions.},

	abstract = {Background Many patients with borderline personality disorder receive pharmacological treatment, but there is uncertainty about the usefulness of such therapies. Aims To evaluate the evidence of effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in treating different facets of the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder. Method A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised comparisons of drug v. placebo, drug v. drug, or single drug v. combined drug treatment in adult patients with borderline personality disorder was conducted. Primary outcomes were overall disorder severity as well as specific core symptoms. Secondary outcomes comprised associated psychiatric pathology and drug tolerability. Results Twenty-seven trials were included in which first- and second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, antidepressants and omega-3 fatty acids were tested. Most beneficial effects were found for the mood stabilisers topiramate, lamotrigine and valproate semisodium, and the second-generation antipsychotics aripiprazole and olanzapine. However, the robustness of findings is low, since they are based mostly on single, small studies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors so far lack high-level evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions The current evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that drug treatment, especially with mood stabilisers and second-generation antipsychotics, may be effective for treating a number of core symptoms and associated psychopathology, but the evidence does not currently support effectiveness for overall severity of borderline personality disorder.

When analysed by drug type, significant effects were found in the pooled analysis of three phenytoin trials (SMD = -1.34, 95\% CI -2.16 to -0.52), one lithium trial (SMD = -0.81, 95\% CI -1.35 to -0.28), and two oxcarbazepine/carbamazepine trials (SMD = -1.20, 95\% CI -1.83 to -0.56).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND People with a history of self-harm are at a far greater risk of suicide than the general population. However, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex. AIMS To undertake the first systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies of risk factors and risk assessment scales to predict suicide following self-harm. METHOD We conducted a search for prospective cohort studies of populations who had self-harmed. For the review of risk scales we also included studies examining the risk of suicide in people under specialist mental healthcare, in order to broaden the scope of the review and increase the number of studies considered. Differences in predictive accuracy between populations were examined where applicable. RESULTS Twelve studies on risk factors and 7 studies on risk scales were included. Four risk factors emerged from the meta-analysis, with robust effect sizes that showed little change when adjusted for important potential confounders. These included: previous episodes of self-harm (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.68, 95\% CI 1.38-2.05, K = 4), suicidal intent (HR = 2.7, 95\% CI 1.91-3.81, K = 3), physical health problems (HR = 1.99, 95\% CI 1.16-3.43, K = 3) and male gender (HR = 2.05, 95\% CI 1.70-2.46, K = 5). The included studies evaluated only three risk scales (Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) and Scale for Suicide Ideation). Where meta-analyses were possible (BHS, SIS), the analysis was based on sparse data and a high heterogeneity was observed. The positive predictive values ranged from 1.3 to 16.7\%. CONCLUSIONS The four risk factors that emerged, although of interest, are unlikely to be of much practical use because they are comparatively common in clinical populations. No scales have sufficient evidence to support their use. The use of these scales, or an over-reliance on the identification of risk factors in clinical practice, may provide false reassurance and is, therefore, potentially dangerous. Comprehensive psychosocial assessments of the risks and needs that are specific to the individual should be central to the management of people who have self-harmed.},

The protein constellation of sperm cells and its subcellular structures has been established for a variety of animal species.

	abstract = {Proteomic studies are contributing greatly to our understanding of the sperm cell, and more detailed descriptions are expected to clarify additional cellular and molecular sperm attributes. The aim of this study was to characterize the subcellular proteome of the human sperm tail and, hopefully, identify less concentrated proteins (not found in whole cell proteome studies). Specifically, we were interested in characterizing the sperm metabolic proteome and gaining new insights into the sperm metabolism issue. Sperm were isolated from normozoospermic semen samples and depleted of any contaminating leukocytes. Tail fractions were obtained by means of sonication followed by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation, and their purity was confirmed via various techniques. Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry of isolated sperm tail peptides resulted in the identification of 1049 proteins, more than half of which had not been previously described in human sperm. The categorization of proteins according to their function revealed two main groups: proteins related to metabolism and energy production (26\%), and proteins related to sperm tail structure and motility (11\%). Interestingly, a great proportion of the metabolic proteome (24\%) comprised enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, including enzymes for mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Unexpectedly, we also identified various peroxisomal proteins, some of which are known to be involved in the oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. Analysis of our data using Reactome suggests that both mitochondrial and peroxisomal pathways might indeed be active in sperm, and that the use of fatty acids as fuel might be more preponderant than previously thought. In addition, incubation of sperm with the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor etomoxir resulted in a significant decrease in sperm motility. Contradicting a common concept in the literature, we suggest that the male gamete might have the capacity to obtain energy from endogenous pools, and thus to adapt to putative exogenous fluctuations.},

This work investigates phosphoproteins underlying human sperm motility by using differential phosphoproteomic in two human sperm subpopulations: high (HM) and low (LM) motility, obtained by centrifugation in a density gradient. Phosphoproteomics (HPLC-MS/MS triple TOF), comparing human LM and HM phosphoproteomes, identified 210 phosphopeptides with different abundance that correspond with 119 sperm proteins. Analysis showed that 40\% of phosphoproteins in LM spermatozoa are involved in metabolism, (catabolism, protein transport, lipid biosynthesis), 25\% in spermatogenesis and sperm function, 8\% in immune system and 6\% in DNA repair. In HM spermatozoa, 48\% of phosphoproteins are related to spermatogenesis and sperm function (motility), whereas 8\% are associated to metabolism. GSK3α resulted one of the most abundant phosphoproteins in HM spermatozoa. Western blot confirmed that GSK3α phosphorylation is higher in HM spermatozoa. Summarizing, this study i) identified phosphoproteins in two human spermatozoa populations, ii) supports that human spermatozoa rely in protein phosphorylation, such as GSK3 α, to regulate sperm motility, iv) raises the challenge of using some identified human sperm phosphorylated proteins (GSK3α) as targets to develop into clinically relevant biomarkers. SIGNIFICANCE: Human sperm phosphoproteome analyzed by nano HPLC-MS/MS triple TOF identifies the differential abundance of sperm phosphoproteins in two human sperm populations exhibiting high motility (HM) and/or low motility (LM) that were isolated from normozoospermic healthy donors. Majority of human phosphoproteins found in LM spermatozoa are involved in sperm metabolism (40\%), whereas those in HM spermatozoa are associated to spermatogenesis and sperm function, as motility (48\%), and only 8\% are associated to metabolism. One of the most abundant phosphoproteins found in HM spermatozoa is GSK3α, kinase directly involved in the regulation of sperm motility that was also validated by western blot. The biological relevance of this study is based in the fact that supports that mature human sperm cells rely in protein phosphorylation to efficiently regulate sperm motility and allows identifying those regulatory human sperm phosphoproteins. This work will clearly impacts the human reproductive field as it raises the challenge of consider identified human sperm phosphoproteins, such as GSK3α, as potential biological targets to develop into relevant biomarkers for the human clinic or assisted reproductive technology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human sperm cell is very well suited for proteomic studies, as it is accessible, can be easily purified and is believed to be transcriptionally and translationally silent. The recent use of advanced proteomic approaches is clearly challenging the understanding of sperm biology. The aims of this review are to discuss the various human sperm proteomic studies, to create a compiled list of all the sperm proteins described to date and to re-assess the potential functional implications.
METHODS: A search of the scientific literature available in the PubMed/Medline database at 31 December 2012 was conducted for studies on human sperm proteomics. The complete list of proteins obtained was carefully analysed using different bioinformatics tools, including Reactome, a knowledgebase of biological pathways.
RESULTS: A total of 30 studies were identified. The proteomics studies have resulted in the identification of 6198 different proteins, an important proportion of which (around 30\%) are known to be expressed in the testis. The proteins were assigned to various functional pathways, including metabolism, apoptosis, cell cycle, meiosis and membrane trafficking, among others. Unexpectedly, the sperm cell also contains a range of proteins involved in RNA metabolism and translational regulation, as well as proteins usually located in organelles believed to be absent in sperm, such as cytoplasmatic ribosomes and peroxisomes. Additionally, some proteins whose levels seem to be altered in low-quality sperm might have clinical relevance.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the most complete sperm proteome available to date indicates the presence of several cellular protein pathways previously ignored in the male gamete. Confirming the activity of each of these pathways and understanding their biological significance will certainly boost the knowledge of human sperm and male fertility and infertility in the next years.},

	abstract = {While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce CARNIVAL, a causal network contextualization tool which derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) integrates different sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed protein–protein interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures. The use of prior knowledge in CARNIVAL enables capturing a broad set of upstream cellular processes and regulators, leading to a higher accuracy when benchmarked against related tools. Implementation as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem guarantees efficient computation. As a case study, we applied CARNIVAL to contextualize signaling networks from gene expression data in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a condition that can lead to chronic kidney disease. CARNIVAL identified specific signaling pathways and associated mediators dysregulated in IgAN including Wnt and TGF-β, which we subsequently validated experimentally. These results demonstrated how CARNIVAL generates hypotheses on potential upstream alterations that propagate through signaling networks, providing insights into diseases.},

	abstract = {The new mechanics of the atom introduced by Heisenberg may be based on the assumption that the variables that describe a dynamical system do not obey the commutative law of multiplication, but satisfy instead certain quantum conditions. One can build up a theory without knowing anything about the dynamical variables except the algebraic laws that they are subject to, and can show that they may be represented by matrices whenever a set of uniformising variables for the dynamical system exists. It may be shown, however (see 3), that there is no set of uniformising variables for a system containing more than one electron, so that the theory cannot progress very far on these lines. A new development of the theory has recently been given by Schrödinger. Starting from the idea that an atomic system cannot be represented by a trajectory, i. e., by a point moving through the co-ordinate space, but must be represented by a wave in this space, Schrödinger obtains from a variation prin­ciple a differential equation which the wave function ψ must satisty. This differential equation turns out to be very closely connected with the Hamiltonian equation which specifies the system, namely, if H (qr, Pr - W = 0 is the Hamiltonian equation of the system, where the qr, Pr are canonical variables, then the wave equation for ψ is \{H(qr, ih ∂/∂q) - W\} ψ = 0.},

The most commonly used approach for all-electron electronic structure calculations in general—the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method—is discussed in combination with Gaussian, Slater a.k.a. exponential, and numerical radial functions. Even though LCAO calculations have major benefits, their shortcomings motivate the need for fully numerical approaches based on, for example, finite differences, finite elements, or the discrete variable representation, which are also briefly introduced. Applications of fully numerical approaches for general molecules are briefly reviewed, and their challenges are discussed. It is pointed out that the high level of symmetry present in atoms and diatomic molecules can be exploited to fashion more efficient fully numerical approaches for these special cases, after which it is possible to routinely perform all-electron Hartree-Fock and density functional calculations directly at the basis set limit on such systems. Applications of fully numerical approaches to calculations on atoms as well as diatomic molecules are reviewed. Finally, a summary and outlook is given.},

There is no treatment of the separations between the various terms of a multiplet, since that has been done elsewhere, but only between one multiplet and another. It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and S values lie lowest, has no general significance; the present theory leads to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally, but many cases which were exceptions to that rule are in agreement with the theory.

For the core electrons, the details of the interaction of the electrons in a single nk group are neglected, but an approximate correction is made for the fact that the distributed charge of an electron does not contribute to the field acting on itself (§2).For a given atom the object of the work is to find a field such that the solutions of the wave equation for the core electrons in this field (corrected as just mentioned for each core electron) give a distribution of charge which reproduces the field. This is called the self-consistent field, and the process of finding it is one of successive approximation (§ 3).Approximations to the self-consistent field have been found for He (§ 4), Rb+ (§ 5), Na+, Cl− (§ 9). For He the energy parameter for the solution of the wave equation for one electron in the self-consistent field of the nucleus and the other corresponds to an ionisation potential of 24·85 volts (observed 24·6 volts); this agreement suggests that for other atoms the values of the energy parameter in the self-consistent field (corrected for each core electron) will probably give good approximations to the X-ray terms (§4).The most extensive work has been carried out for Rb+. The distribution of charge given by the wave functions in the self-consistent field is compared with the distribution calculated by other methods (§ 6). The values of X-ray and optical terms calculated from the self-consistent field show satisfactory agreement with those observed (§ 7).The wave mechanical analogue of the case in which on the orbital model an internal and an external orbit of the same energy are possible is discussed (§ 8).},

	url = {https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.603888},
	abstract = {The work described in this dissertation concerns the development of new methods for performing computer simulations of real materials from first principles or {\textless}I{\textgreater}ab initio {\textless}/I{\textgreater}i.e. using the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics and only well-controlled approximations. In particular, these methods have been developed within the framework of density-functional theory and therefore lie in the realms of both quantum chemistry and computational condensed matter physics. The work is particularly concerned with methods which are efficient in the sense that the computational effort required scales only linearly with system-size (i.e. the volume or number of electrons) whereas traditional methods have scaled with the cube of the system-size which has restricted their range of applicability. The aim of this work is therefore to extend the scope of {\textless}I{\textgreater}ab initio {\textless}/I{\textgreater}quantum-mechanical calculations beyond what is currently possible. Density-functional theory has traditionally been applied by making use of a mapping from the system of interacting electrons to a fictitious system of non-interacting particles. However, the need to maintain the mutual orthogonality of the wave functions of the fictitious system leads to the cubic scaling mentioned above, and is ultimately responsible for limiting the maximum size of systems which can be treated. Making use of a reformulation of the problem in terms of the single-particle density-matrix eliminates the need to work with the wave functions directly. Moreover, exploiting the short-ranged nature of the density-matrix leads in principle to a linear-scaling method. The dissertation tackles two issues which are relevant to obtaining practical schemes for performing linear-scaling calculations. Firstly a localised basis set is developed which is used to describe the density-matrix computationally. Analytic results for several key quantities required by the calculation are derived, namely the overlap, kinetic energy and non-local pseudopotential matrix elements. These results allow accurate calculation of the total energy of the system and have been implemented and tested computationally. Secondly, the dissertation discusses several methods for imposing the difficult non-linear idempotency constraint on the density-matrix.},

	abstract = {Ferroptosis is a form of cell death primed by iron and lipid hydroperoxides and prevented by GPx4. Ferrostatin-1 (fer-1) inhibits ferroptosis much more efficiently than phenolic antioxidants. Previous studies on the antioxidant efficiency of fer-1 adopted kinetic tests where a diazo compound generates the hydroperoxyl radical scavenged by the antioxidant. However, this reaction, accounting for a chain breaking effect, is only minimally useful for the description of the inhibition of ferrous iron and lipid hydroperoxide dependent peroxidation. Scavenging lipid hydroperoxyl radicals, indeed, generates lipid hydroperoxides from which ferrous iron initiates a new peroxidative chain reaction. We show that when fer-1 inhibits peroxidation, initiated by iron and traces of lipid hydroperoxides in liposomes, the pattern of oxidized species produced from traces of pre-existing hydroperoxides is practically identical to that observed following exhaustive peroxidation in the absence of the antioxidant. This supported the notion that the anti-ferroptotic activity of fer-1 is actually due to the scavenging of initiating alkoxyl radicals produced, together with other rearrangement products, by ferrous iron from lipid hydroperoxides. Notably, fer-1 is not consumed while inhibiting iron dependent lipid peroxidation. The emerging concept is that it is ferrous iron itself that reduces fer-1 radical. This was supported by electroanalytical evidence that fer-1 forms a complex with iron and further confirmed in cells by fluorescence of calcein, indicating a decrease of labile iron in the presence of fer-1. The notion of such as pseudo-catalytic cycle of the ferrostatin-iron complex was also investigated by means of quantum mechanics calculations, which confirmed the reduction of an alkoxyl radical model by fer-1 and the reduction of fer-1 radical by ferrous iron. In summary, GPx4 and fer-1 in the presence of ferrous iron, produces, by distinct mechanism, the most relevant anti-ferroptotic effect, i.e the disappearance of initiating lipid hydroperoxides.},

	abstract = {There are no validated biomarkers for schizophrenia (SCZ), a disorder linked to neural network dysfunction. We demonstrate that collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2), a master regulator of cytoskeleton and, hence, neural circuitry, may form the basis for a biomarker because its activity is uniquely imbalanced in SCZ patients. CRMP2’s activity depends upon its phosphorylation state. While an equilibrium between inactive (phosphorylated) and active (nonphosphorylated) CRMP2 is present in unaffected individuals, we show that SCZ patients are characterized by excess active CRMP2. We examined CRMP2 levels first in postmortem brains (correlated with neuronal morphometrics) and then, because CRMP2 is expressed in lymphocytes as well, in the peripheral blood of SCZ patients versus age-matched unaffected controls. In the brains and, more starkly, in the lymphocytes of SCZ patients {\textless}40 y old, we observed that nonphosphorylated CRMP2 was higher than in controls, while phosphorylated CRMP2 remained unchanged from control. In the brain, these changes were associated with dendritic structural abnormalities. The abundance of active CRMP2 with insufficient opposing inactive p-CRMP2 yielded a unique lowering of the p-CRMP2:CRMP2 ratio in SCZ patients, implying a disruption in the normal equilibrium between active and inactive CRMP2. These clinical data suggest that measuring CRMP2 and p-CRMP2 in peripheral blood might reflect intracerebral processes and suggest a rapid, minimally invasive, sensitive, and specific adjunctive diagnostic aid for early SCZ: increased CRMP2 or a decreased p-CRMP2:CRMP2 ratio may help cinch the diagnosis in a newly presenting young patient suspected of SCZ (versus such mimics as mania in bipolar disorder, where the ratio is high).},

New genes include members of well-studied families as well as previously unidentified families, some of which are conserved in model organisms.

Due to the high complexity of genomic data, AI techniques are increasingly needed to help reduce this and aid the adoption of optimal decisions. Phenotypic prediction is of particular use to drug discovery and precision medicine where sets of genes that predict a given phenotype are determined. Phenotypic prediction is an undetermined problem given that the number of monitored genetic probes markedly exceeds the number of collected samples (from patients). This imbalance creates ambiguity in the characterization of the biological pathways that are responsible for disease development. Areas covered: In this paper, the authors present AI methodologies that perform a robust deep sampling of altered genetic pathways to locate new therapeutic targets, assist in drug repurposing and speed up and optimize the drug selection process. Expert opinion: AI is a potential solution to a number of drug discovery problems, though one should, bear in mind that the quality of data predicts the overall quality of the prediction, as in any modeling task in data science. The use of transparent methodologies is crucial, particularly in drug repositioning/repurposing in rare diseases.},

Unlike multi-layer convolutional neural networks, DeepPhos consists of densely connected convolutional neuron network blocks which can capture multiple representations of sequences to make final phosphorylation prediction by intra block concatenation layers and inter block concatenation layers. DeepPhos can also be used for kinase-specific prediction varying from group, family, subfamily and individual kinase level. The experimental results demonstrated that DeepPhos outperforms competitive predictors in general and kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction.The source code of DeepPhos is publicly deposited at https://github.com/USTCHIlab/DeepPhos.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein kinases are a well defined family of proteins, characterized by the presence of a common kinase catalytic domain and playing a significant role in many important cellular processes, such as proliferation, maintenance of cell shape, apoptosis. In many members of the family, additional non-kinase domains contribute further specialization, resulting in subcellular localization, protein binding and regulation of activity, among others. About 500 genes encode members of the kinase family in the human genome, and although many of them represent well known genes, a larger number of genes code for proteins of more recent identification, or for unknown proteins identified as kinase only after computational studies.
RESULTS: A systematic in silico study performed on the human genome, led to the identification of 5 genes, on chromosome 1, 11, 13, 15 and 16 respectively, and 1 pseudogene on chromosome X; some of these genes are reported as kinases from NCBI but are absent in other databases, such as KinBase. Comparative analysis of 483 gene regions and subsequent computational analysis, aimed at identifying unannotated exons, indicates that a large number of kinase may code for alternately spliced forms or be incorrectly annotated. An InterProScan automated analysis was performed to study domain distribution and combination in the various families. At the same time, other structural features were also added to the annotation process, including the putative presence of transmembrane alpha helices, and the cystein propensity to participate into a disulfide bridge.
CONCLUSION: The predicted human kinome was extended by identifying both additional genes and potential splice variants, resulting in a varied panorama where functionality may be searched at the gene and protein level. Structural analysis of kinase proteins domains as defined in multiple sources together with transmembrane alpha helices and signal peptide prediction provides hints to function assignment. The results of the human kinome analysis are collected in the KinWeb database, available for browsing and searching over the internet, where all results from the comparative analysis and the gene structure annotation are made available, alongside the domain information. Kinases may be searched by domain combinations and the relative genes may be viewed in a graphic browser at various level of magnification up to gene organization on the full chromosome set.},

	abstract = {Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequently reported single cause of safety-related withdrawal of marketed drugs. It is essential to identify drugs with DILI potential at the early stages of drug development. In this study, we describe a deep learning-powered DILI (DeepDILI) prediction model created by combining model-level representation generated by conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms with a deep learning framework based on Mold2 descriptors. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepDILI model performance by posing several critical questions: (1) Could the DILI potential of newly approved drugs be predicted by accumulated knowledge of early approved ones? (2) is model-level representation more informative than molecule-based representation for DILI prediction? and (3) could improved model explainability be established? For question 1, we developed the DeepDILI model using drugs approved before 1997 to predict the DILI potential of those approved thereafter. As a result, the DeepDILI model outperformed the five conventional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art ensemble methods with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.331. For question 2, we demonstrated that the DeepDILI model's performance was significantly improved (i.e., a MCC improvement of 25.86\% in test set) compared with deep neural networks based on molecule-based representation. For question 3, we found 21 chemical descriptors that were enriched, suggesting a strong association with DILI outcome. Furthermore, we found that the DeepDILI model has more discrimination power to identify the DILI potential of drugs belonging to the World Health Organization therapeutic category of 'alimentary tract and metabolism'. Moreover, the DeepDILI model based on Mold2 descriptors outperformed the ones with Mol2vec and MACCS descriptors. Finally, the DeepDILI model was applied to the recent real-world problem of predicting any DILI concern for potential COVID-19 treatments from repositioning drug candidates. Altogether, this developed DeepDILI model could serve as a promising tool for screening for DILI risk of compounds in the preclinical setting, and the DeepDILI model is publicly available through https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepDILI.},

Next, we used a novel strategy to build a schizophrenia bioenergetic profile by a tailored application of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures data portal (iLINCS) and investigated connected cellular pathways, kinases, and transcription factors using Enrichr. Finally, with the goal of identifying drugs capable of “reversing” the bioenergetic schizophrenia signature, we performed a connectivity analysis with iLINCS and identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists as promising therapeutic targets. We administered a PPAR agonist to the GluN1 knockdown model of schizophrenia and found it improved long-term memory. Taken together, our findings suggest that tailored bioinformatics approaches, coupled with the LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of chemical and genetic perturbagens, may be employed to identify novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and related diseases.},

However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML-driven solutions have an unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area.

	abstract = {To elucidate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in therapeutics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Five databases were searched (December 2019-May 2020). We included both published and pre-print original articles in English that applied AI, machine learning or deep learning in drug repurposing, novel drug discovery, vaccine and antibody development for COVID-19. Out of 31 studies included, 16 studies applied AI for drug repurposing, whereas 10 studies utilized AI for novel drug discovery. Only four studies used AI technology for vaccine development, whereas one study generated stable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Approx. 50\% of studies exclusively targeted 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2, and only two studies targeted ACE/TMPSS2 for inhibiting host viral interactions. Around 16\% of the identified drugs are in different phases of clinical evaluation against COVID-19. AI has emerged as a promising solution of COVID-19 therapeutics. During this current pandemic, many of the researchers have used AI-based strategies to process large databases in a more customized manner leading to the faster identification of several potential targets, novel/repurposing of drugs and vaccine candidates. A number of these drugs are either approved or are in a late-stage clinical trial and are potentially effective against SARS-CoV2 indicating validity of the methodology. However, as the use of AI-based screening program is currently in budding stage, sole reliance on such algorithms is not advisable at this current point of time and an evidence based approach is warranted to confirm their usefulness against this life-threatening disease.

	doi = {10.1101/2020.07.19.211235},
	abstract = {Target-based high-throughput compound screening dominates conventional one-drug-one-gene drug discovery process. However, the readout from the chemical modulation of a single protein is poorly correlated with phenotypic response of organism, leading to high failure rate in drug development. Chemical-induced gene expression profile provides an attractive solution to phenotype-based screening. However, the use of such data is currently limited by their sparseness, unreliability, and relatively low throughput. Several methods have been proposed to impute missing values for gene expression datasets. However, few existing methods can perform de novo chemical compound screening. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven neural network-based method named DeepCE (Deep Chemical Expression) which utilizes graph convolutional neural network to learn chemical representation and multi-head attention mechanism to model chemical substructure-gene and gene-gene feature associations. In addition, we propose a novel data augmentation method which extracts useful information from unreliable experiments in L1000 dataset. The experimental results show that DeepCE achieves the superior performances not only in de novo chemical setting but also in traditional imputation setting compared to state-of-the-art baselines for the prediction of chemical-induced gene expression. We further verify the effectiveness of gene expression profiles generated from DeepCE by comparing them with gene expression profiles in L1000 dataset for downstream classification tasks including drug-target and disease predictions. To demonstrate the value of DeepCE, we apply it to patient-specific drug repurposing of COVID-19 for the first time, and generate novel lead compounds consistent with clinical evidences. Thus, DeepCE provides a potentially powerful framework for robust predictive modeling by utilizing noisy omics data as well as screening novel chemicals for the modulation of systemic response to disease.},

Unfortunately, additional clinically significant treatment options since the approval of remdesivir are scarce. To overcome the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more efficiently, a treatment strategy that controls not only SARS-CoV-2 replication but also the host entry step should be considered. In this study, we used MT-DTI to predict FDA approved drugs that may have strong affinities for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which are essential for viral entry to the host cell. Of the 460 drugs with Kd of less than 100 nM for the ACE2 receptor, 17 drugs overlapped with drugs that inhibit the interaction of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike reported in the NCATS OpenData portal. Among them, enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, showed a Kd value of 1.5 nM against the ACE2. Furthermore, three of the top 30 drugs with strong affinity prediction for the TMPRSS2 are anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drugs, including ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and paritaprevir. Notably, of the top 30 drugs, AT1R blocker eprosartan and neuropsychiatric drug lisuride showed similar gene expression profiles to potential TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Collectively, we suggest that drugs predicted to have strong inhibitory potencies to ACE2 and TMPRSS2 through the DTI model should be considered as potential drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is sweeping the globe and has resulted in infections in millions of people. Patients with COVID-19 face a high fatality risk once symptoms worsen; therefore, early identification of severely ill patients can enable early intervention, prevent disease progression, and help reduce mortality. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence-assisted tool using computed tomography (CT) imaging to predict disease severity and further estimate the risk of developing severe disease in patients suffering from COVID-19.
Materials and Methods: Initial CT images of 408 confirmed COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected between January 1, 2020 and March 18, 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang. The data of 303 patients in the People's Hospital of Honghu were assigned as the training data, and those of 105 patients in The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were assigned as the test dataset. A deep learning based-model using multiple instance learning and residual convolutional neural network (ResNet34) was developed and validated. The discrimination ability and prediction accuracy of the model were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve and confusion matrix, respectively.
Results: The deep learning-based model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.968-1.00) and an accuracy of 97.4\% in the training set, whereas it had an AUC of 0.892 (0.828-0.955) and an accuracy of 81.9\% in the test set. In the subgroup analysis of patients who had non-severe COVID-19 on admission, the model achieved AUCs of 0.955 (0.884-1.00) and 0.923 (0.864-0.983) and accuracies of 97.0 and 81.6\% in the Honghu and Nanchang subgroups, respectively.
Conclusion: Our deep learning-based model can accurately predict disease severity as well as disease progression in COVID-19 patients using CT imaging, offering promise for guiding clinical treatment.},

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd  {\textless} 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In December 2019, COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, leading to national and international disruptions in health care, business, education, transportation, and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and data sets used for their development and validation.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease (ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data.
RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine.
CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for studies on AI.},

	abstract = {A novel coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, was recently found in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, and now is spreading across China and other parts of the world. Although there are some drugs to treat 2019-nCoV, there is no proper scientific evidence about its activity on the virus. It is of high significance to develop a drug that can combat the virus effectively to save valuable human lives. It usually takes a much longer time to develop a drug using traditional methods. For 2019-nCoV, it is now better to rely on some alternative methods such as deep learning to develop drugs that can combat such a disease effectively since 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to SARS-CoV. In the present work, we first collected virus RNA sequences of 18 patients reported to have 2019-nCoV from the public domain database, translated the RNA into protein sequences, and performed multiple sequence alignment. After a careful literature survey and sequence analysis, 3C-like protease is considered to be a major therapeutic target and we built a protein 3D model of 3C-like protease using homology modeling. Relying on the structural model, we used a pipeline to perform large scale virtual screening by using a deep learning based method to accurately rank/identify protein-ligand interacting pairs developed recently in our group. Our model identified potential drugs for 2019-nCoV 3C-like protease by performing drug screening against four chemical compound databases (Chimdiv, Targetmol-Approved\_Drug\_Library, Targetmol-Natural\_Compound\_Library, and Targetmol-Bioactive\_Compound\_Library) and a database of tripeptides. Through this paper, we provided the list of possible chemical ligands (Meglumine, Vidarabine, Adenosine, D-Sorbitol, D-Mannitol, Sodium\_gluconate, Ganciclovir and Chlorobutanol) and peptide drugs (combination of isoleucine, lysine and proline) from the databases to guide the experimental scientists and validate the molecules which can combat the virus in a shorter time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 outbreak has created havoc and a quick cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has usage history in patients to resolve the current pandemic. With technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) coupled with increased computational power, the AI-empowered drug repurposing can prove beneficial in the COVID-19 scenario.
METHODS: The recent literature is studied and analyzed from various sources such as Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search terms used are 'COVID-19', ' AI ', and 'Drug Repurposing'.
RESULTS: AI is implemented in the field design through the generation of the learning-prediction model and performs a quick virtual screening to accurately display the output. With a drug-repositioning strategy, AI can quickly detect drugs that can fight against emerging diseases such as COVID-19. This technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery, planning, treatment, and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, there are chances that the application of the AI approach in drug discovery is feasible. With prior usage experiences in patients, few of the old drugs, if shown active against SARS-CoV-2, can be readily applied to treat the COVID-19 patients. With the collaboration of AI with pharmacology, the efficiency of drug repurposing can improve significantly.},

In this study, we propose a deep representation on heterogeneous drug networks, termed DeepR2cov, to discover potential agents for treating the excessive inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. This work explores the multi-hub characteristic of a heterogeneous drug network integrating eight unique networks. Inspired by the multi-hub characteristic, we design 3 billion special meta paths to train a deep representation model for learning low-dimensional vectors that integrate long-range structure dependency and complex semantic relation among network nodes. Based on the representation vectors and transcriptomics data, we predict 22 drugs that bind to tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-6, whose therapeutic associations with the inflammation storm in COVID-19 patients, and molecular binding model are further validated via data from PubMed publications, ongoing clinical trials and a docking program. In addition, the results on five biomedical applications suggest that DeepR2cov significantly outperforms five existing representation approaches. In summary, DeepR2cov is a powerful network representation approach and holds the potential to accelerate treatment of the inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients.

We assessed anatomical and electrophysiological synaptic E/I ratios in post-mortem parietal cortex samples from middle-aged individuals with AD (early-onset) or Down syndrome (DS) by fluorescence deconvolution tomography and microtransplantation of synaptic membranes. Both approaches revealed significantly elevated E/I ratios for AD, but not DS, versus controls. Gene expression studies in an independent AD cohort also demonstrated elevated E/I ratios in individuals with AD as compared to controls. These findings provide evidence of a marked pro-excitatory perturbation of synaptic E/I balance in AD parietal cortex, a region within the default mode network that is overly active in the disorder, and support the hypothesis that E/I imbalances disrupt cognition-related shifts in cortical activity which contribute to the intellectual decline in AD.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2974},
	abstract = {Importance: Findings from unbiased genetic studies have consistently implicated synaptic protein networks in schizophrenia, but the molecular pathologic features within these networks and their contribution to the synaptic and circuit deficits thought to underlie disease symptoms remain unknown.
Objective: To determine whether protein levels are altered within synapses from the primary auditory cortex (A1) of individuals with schizophrenia and, if so, whether these differences are restricted to the synapse or occur throughout the gray matter.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This paired case-control study included tissue samples from individuals with schizophrenia obtained from the Allegheny County Office of the Medical Examiner. An independent panel of health care professionals made consensus DSM-IV diagnoses. Each tissue sample from an individual with schizophrenia was matched by sex, age, and postmortem interval with 1 sample from an unaffected control individual. Targeted mass spectrometry was used to measure protein levels in A1 gray matter homogenate and synaptosome preparations. All experimenters were blinded to diagnosis. Mass spectrometry data were collected from September 26 through November 4, 2016, and analyzed from November 3, 2016, to July 15, 2019.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary measures were homogenate and synaptosome protein levels and their coregulation network features. Hypotheses generated before data collection were (1) that levels of canonical postsynaptic proteins in A1 synaptosome preparations would differ between individuals with schizophrenia and controls and (2) that these differences would not be explained by changes in total A1 homogenate protein levels.
Results: Synaptosome and homogenate protein levels were investigated in 48 individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis and 48 controls (mean age in both groups, 48 years [range, 17-83 years]); each group included 35 males (73\%) and 13 females (27\%). Robust alterations (statistical cutoff set at an adjusted Limma P {\textless} .05) were observed in synaptosome levels of canonical mitochondrial and postsynaptic proteins that were highly coregulated and not readily explained by postmortem interval, antipsychotic drug treatment, synaptosome yield, or underlying alterations in homogenate protein levels.
Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest a robust and highly coordinated rearrangement of the synaptic proteome. In line with unbiased genetic findings, alterations in synaptic levels of postsynaptic proteins were identified, providing a road map to identify the specific cells and circuits that are impaired in individuals with schizophrenia A1.},

	abstract = {Markers of inhibitory neurotransmission are altered in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of subjects with schizophrenia, and several lines of evidence suggest that these alterations may be most prominent in the subset of GABA-containing neurons that express the calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin (PV). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of mRNAs for PV, another calcium-binding protein, calretinin (CR), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in postmortem brain specimens from 15 pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and matched control subjects using single- and dual-label in situ hybridization. Signal intensity for PV mRNA expression in PFC area 9 was significantly decreased in the subjects with schizophrenia, predominantly in layers III and IV. Analysis at the cellular level revealed that this decrease was attributable principally to a reduction in PV mRNA expression per neuron rather than by a decreased density of PV mRNA-positive neurons. In contrast, the same measures of CR mRNA expression were not altered in schizophrenia. These findings were confirmed by findings from cDNA microarray studies using different probes. Across the subjects with schizophrenia, the decrease in neuronal PV mRNA expression was highly associated (r = 0.84) with the decrease in the density of neurons containing detectable levels of GAD67 mRNA. Furthermore, simultaneous detection of PV and GAD67 mRNAs revealed that in subjects with schizophrenia only 55\% of PV mRNA-positive neurons had detectable levels of GAD67 mRNA. Given the critical role that PV-containing GABA neurons appear to play in regulating the cognitive functions mediated by the PFC, the selective alterations in gene expression in these neurons may contribute to the cognitive deficits characteristic of schizophrenia.},

In dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), similar in vivo observations of reduced regional volume and working memory deficits in subjects with schizophrenia have been related to reduced somal volume of deep layer 3 pyramidal cells. We hypothesized that deep layer 3 pyramidal cell somal volume would also be reduced in auditory association cortex (BA42) in schizophrenia. We used the nucleator to estimate the somal volume of pyramidal neurons in deep layer 3 of BA42 in 18 subjects with schizophrenia, each of whom was matched to one normal comparison subject for gender, age, and post-mortem interval. For all subject pairs, somal volume of pyramidal neurons in deep layer 3 of dPFC (BA9) had previously been determined. In BA42, somal volume was reduced by 13.1\% in schizophrenic subjects (p=0.03). Reductions in somal volume were not associated with the history of antipsychotic use, alcohol dependence, schizoaffective disorder, or death by suicide. The percent change in somal volume within-subject pairs was highly correlated between BA42 and BA9 (r=0.67, p=0.002). Deep layer 3 pyramidal cell somal volume is reduced in BA42 of subjects with schizophrenia. This reduction may contribute to impairment in auditory function. The correlated reductions of somal volume in BA42 and BA9 suggest that a common factor may affect deep layer 3 pyramidal cells in both regions.},

This database entry has been recently annotated as two highly homologous members of a heat-shock protein family (HSPA12A and HSPA12B).
METHODS: We followed up our initial results by in situ hybridization in subjects with schizophrenia, major depression, and a chronic haloperidol-treated nonhuman primate model. Furthermore, we investigated the distribution of HSPA12A and HSPA12B transcripts across the human and nonhuman primate brain.
RESULTS: We found that HSPA12A (but not HSPA12B) is highly expressed in the human brain and shows a neuron- and region-specific transcript distribution, with strongest expression in the frontal and occipital cortical regions. HSPA12A messenger ribonucleic acid was significantly reduced (p {\textless} .01; mean log2 optical density difference = -.84) across subjects with schizophrenia but not in the DLPFC of subjects with major depression or in monkeys chronically treated with haloperidol.
CONCLUSIONS: The data are consistent with metabolic alterations in schizophrenia, reflected in selective changes in the expression of certain genes encoding proteins involved in cellular metabolism or metabolic responsiveness.},

	abstract = {Seven distinct 14-3-3 proteins are expressed in mammals. One of the 14-3-3 genes (eta) has been previously associated with decreased expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of subjects with schizophrenia. DNA microarray analysis of the PFC of 10 subjects with schizophrenia and 10 matched controls indicated that the majority of 14-3-3 genes exhibited moderate to marked decreases in expression in schizophrenia, which were significant at the group level across all 10 comparisons (p{\textless}0.021). Selected changes in gene expression were further examined using in situ hybridization (ISH) in the same subject pairs as well as in four monkeys treated chronically with haloperidol and matched control animals. All analyses were performed blind to subject identity and diagnosis, or treatment. ISH analysis and multivariate analysis of covariance confirmed the significant decreases in expression of two 14-3-3 genes: beta -31.9\%, zeta -18.2\%. Two other 14-3-3 genes exhibited more modest decreases in expression levels that were significant only in pairwise comparisons that did not factor in post-mortem interval or tissue storage time: gamma -11.9\%, eta -15.4\%. In the PFC of haloperidol-treated monkeys, there was no difference in 14-3-3 zeta expression, while 14-3-3 beta increased 28\% (p{\textless}0.05) as a result of neuroleptic treatment. Our results suggest that decreased expression of selected 14-3-3 genes is a common feature of schizophrenia and that the 14-3-3 beta transcript may be unique among the 14-3-3 genes in its increase in response to haloperidol and decrease in the disease state.},

Immunoreactivity (IR) for the nonphosphorylated epitopes of neurofilament protein (NNFP) identifies a subset of large dPFC deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons. We tested the hypotheses that the average size of NNFP-IR neurons is smaller in schizophrenia and that the decrease in size of these neurons is greater than that observed in the general population of deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons.
METHODS: We estimated the mean somal volume of NNFP-IR neurons in deep layer 3 of 9 in 13 matched pairs of control and schizophrenia subjects and compared the differences in somal size of NNFP-IR neurons to the differences in size of all deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons identified in Nissl-stained material.
RESULTS: In subjects with schizophrenia, the somal volume of NNFP-IR neurons was nonsignificantly decreased by 6.6\%, whereas that of the Nissl-stained pyramidal neurons was significantly decreased by 14.2\%.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the NNFP-IR subpopulation of dPFC pyramidal neurons are not preferentially affected in schizophrenia. Thus, a subpopulation of dPFC deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons, other than those identified by NNFP-IR, may be selectively vulnerable in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been associated with cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Levels of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67-kDa isoform (GAD67) in the PFC have been consistently reported to be lower in patients with these disorders, but the status of the second GABA-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kDa isoform (GAD65), remains unclear.
METHODS: GAD65 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were quantified in PFC area 9 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction from 62 subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 62 matched healthy comparison subjects. In a subset of subject pairs, GAD65 relative protein levels were quantified by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: Mean GAD65 mRNA levels were 13.6\% lower in subjects with schizoaffective disorder but did not differ in subjects with schizophrenia relative to their matched healthy comparison subjects. In the subjects with schizoaffective disorder, mean GAD65 protein levels were 19.4\% lower and were correlated with GAD65 mRNA levels. Lower GAD65 mRNA and protein levels within subjects with schizoaffective disorder were not attributable to factors commonly comorbid with the diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In concert with previous studies, these findings suggest that schizoaffective disorder is associated with lower levels of both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA and protein in the PFC, whereas subjects with schizophrenia have lower mean levels of only GAD67 mRNA and protein. Because cognitive function is generally better preserved in patients with schizoaffective disorder relative to patients with schizophrenia, these findings may support an interpretation that GAD65 downregulation provides a homeostatic response complementary to GAD67 downregulation that serves to reduce inhibition in the face of lower PFC network activity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with altered activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which has been attributed to lower expression of the 67 kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), the major γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-synthesizing enzyme. However, little is known about the relationship of prefrontal GAD67 mRNA levels and illness severity, translation of the transcript into protein, and protein levels in axon terminals, the key site of GABA production and function.
METHOD: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure GAD67 mRNA levels in postmortem specimens of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from subjects with schizophrenia and matched comparison subjects with no known history of psychiatric or neurological disorders (N=42 pairs). In a subset of this cohort in which potential confounds of protein measures were controlled (N=19 pairs), Western blotting was used to quantify tissue levels of GAD67 protein in tissue. In five of these pairs, multilabel confocal immunofluorescence was used to quantify GAD67 protein levels in the axon terminals of parvalbumin-containing GABA neurons, which are known to have low levels of GAD67 mRNA in schizophrenia.
RESULTS: GAD67 mRNA levels were significantly lower in schizophrenia subjects (by 15\%), but transcript levels were not associated with predictors or measures of illness severity or chronicity. In schizophrenia subjects, GAD67 protein levels were significantly lower in total gray matter (by 10\%) and in parvalbumin axon terminals (by 49\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings that lower GAD67 mRNA expression is common in schizophrenia, that it is not a consequence of having the illness, and that it leads to less translation of the protein, especially in the axon terminals of parvalbumin-containing neurons, support the hypothesis that lower GABA synthesis in parvalbumin neurons contributes to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction and impaired cognition in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cognitive deficits of schizophrenia may be due at least in part to lower expression of the 67-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), a key enzyme for GABA synthesis, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia. However, little is known about the molecular regulation of lower cortical GAD67 levels in schizophrenia. The GAD67 promoter region contains a conserved Zif268 binding site, and Zif268 activation is accompanied by increased GAD67 expression. Thus, altered expression of the immediate early gene Zif268 may contribute to lower levels of GAD67 mRNA in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.
METHOD: The authors used polymerase chain reaction to quantify GAD67 and Zif268 mRNA levels in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex area 9 from 62 matched pairs of schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects, and in situ hybridization to assess Zif268 expression at laminar and cellular levels of resolution. The effects of potentially confounding variables were assessed in human subjects, and the effects of antipsychotic treatments were tested in antipsychotic-exposed monkeys. The specificity of the Zif268 findings was assessed by quantifying mRNA levels for other immediate early genes.
RESULTS: GAD67 and Zif268 mRNA levels were significantly lower and were positively correlated in the schizophrenia subjects. Both Zif268 mRNA-positive neuron density and Zif268 mRNA levels per neuron were significantly lower in the schizophrenia subjects. These findings were robust to the effects of the confounding variables examined and differed from other immediate early genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Deficient Zif268 mRNA expression may contribute to lower cortical GAD67 levels in schizophrenia, suggesting a potential mechanistic basis for altered cortical GABA synthesis and impaired cognition in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Convergent findings indicate that cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic circuitry is altered in schizophrenia. Postmortem studies have consistently found lower levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) messenger RNA (mRNA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of subjects with schizophrenia. At the cellular level, the density of GABA neurons with detectable levels of GAD67 mRNA is {\textasciitilde}30\% lower across cortical layers. Knowing how this transcript deficit translates to GAD67 protein levels in axonal boutons is important for understanding the impact it might have on GABA synthesis. In addition, because reductions in GAD67 expression before, but not after, the maturation of GABAergic boutons results in a lower density of GABAergic boutons in mouse cortical cultures, knowing if GABAergic bouton density is altered in schizophrenia would provide insight into the timing of the GAD67 deficit.
METHODS: PFC tissue sections from 20 matched pairs of schizophrenia and comparison subjects were immunolabeled for the vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) and GAD67.
RESULTS: vGAT+ bouton density did not differ between subject groups, consistent with findings that vGAT mRNA levels are unaltered in the illness and confirming that the number of cortical GABAergic boutons is not lower in schizophrenia. In contrast, in schizophrenia subjects, the proportion of vGAT+ boutons with detectable GAD67 levels (vGAT+/GAD67+ boutons) was 16\% lower and mean GAD67 levels were 14\% lower in the remaining vGAT+/GAD67+ boutons.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that GABA production is markedly reduced in a subset of boutons in the PFC of schizophrenia subjects and that this reduction likely occurs after the maturation of GABAergic boutons.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is characterized by complex gene expression changes. The transcriptome alterations in the prefrontal cortex have been the subject of several recent postmortem studies that yielded both convergent and divergent findings.
METHODS: To increase measurement precision, we used a custom-designed DNA microarray platform with long oligonucleotides and multiple probes with replicates. The platform was designed to assess the expression of {\textgreater} 1800 genes specifically chosen because of their hypothesized roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The gene expression differences in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from 14 matched pairs of schizophrenia and control subjects were analyzed with two technical replicates and four data mining approaches.
RESULTS: In addition to replicating many expression changes in synaptic, oligodendrocyte, and signal transduction genes, we uncovered and validated a robust immune/chaperone transcript upregulation in the schizophrenia samples.
CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that the overexpression of SERPINA3, IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, CHI3L1, MT2A, CD14, HSPB1, HSPA1B, and HSPA1A in schizophrenia subjects represents a long-lasting and correlated signature of an early environmental insult during development that actively contributes to the pathophysiology of prefrontal dysfunction.},

We have previously reported a deficit in dendritic spine density in deep layer 3 of primary auditory cortex in subjects with schizophrenia. As boutons and spines can be structurally and functionally co-regulated, we asked whether the densities of intracortical excitatory or thalamocortical presynaptic boutons are also reduced. We studied 2 cohorts of subjects with schizophrenia and matched controls, comprising 27 subject pairs, and assessed the density, number, and within-bouton vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT) protein level of intracortical excitatory (VGluT1-immunoreactive) and thalamocortical (VGluT2-immunoreactive) boutons in deep layer 3 of primary auditory cortex using quantitative confocal microscopy and stereologic sampling methods. We found that VGluT1- and VGluT2-immunoreactive puncta densities and numbers were not altered in deep layer 3 of primary auditory cortex of subjects with schizophrenia. Our results indicate that reduced dendritic spine density in primary auditory cortex of subjects with schizophrenia is not matched by a corresponding reduction in excitatory bouton density. This suggests excitatory boutons in primary auditory cortex in schizophrenia may synapse with structures other than spines, such as dendritic shafts, with greater frequency. The discrepancy between dendritic spine reduction and excitatory bouton preservation may contribute to functional impairments of the primary auditory cortex in subjects with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Cannabis use is associated with both impaired cognitive functions, including working memory, and an increased risk of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is characterized by impairments in working memory that are associated with reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) is highly expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is contained in the axon terminals of a subpopulation of perisomatic-targeting GABA neurons, and, when activated, suppresses the release of GABA.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential relationship between CB1R signaling and altered GABA neurotransmission in schizophrenia by evaluating CB1R messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
DESIGN: In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry techniques were used to examine the cortical levels of CB1R mRNA and protein, respectively.
SETTING: Brain specimens were obtained from autopsies conducted at the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
PARTICIPANTS: Postmortem brain specimens from 23 pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and age-, sex-, and postmortem interval-matched comparison subjects, as well as brain specimens from 18 macaque monkeys with long-term exposure to haloperidol, olanzapine, or placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Optical density measures of CB1R mRNA expression and protein levels and correlations with previously reported glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 and cholecystokinin mRNA measures.
RESULTS: Levels of CB1R mRNA were significantly lower by 14.8\% in the subjects with schizophrenia. Similarly, CB1R protein levels, assessed by radioimmunocytochemistry and standard immunocytochemistry, were significantly decreased by 11.6\% and 13.9\%, respectively. Group differences in CB1R mRNA levels were significantly correlated with those in glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 and cholecystokinin mRNA levels. Expression of CB1R mRNA was not changed in antipsychotic-exposed monkeys, and neither CB1R mRNA levels nor protein levels were affected by potential confounding factors in the subjects with schizophrenia.
CONCLUSIONS: This combination of findings suggests the testable hypothesis that reduced CB1R mRNA and protein levels in schizophrenia represent a compensatory mechanism to increase GABA transmission from perisomatic-targeting cholecystokinin interneurons with impaired GABA synthesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcript levels for cytokines and the viral restriction factor interferon-induced transmembrane protein are markedly higher in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. These gene products are regulated by the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcriptional complex. NF-κB activity, which requires the formation of NF-κB family member heterodimers, is regulated by activation receptors, kinases, and inhibitors. Whether any of these factors are altered in schizophrenia is not known. It is also unclear whether NF-κB-related disturbances reflect ongoing cortical immune activation or a long-lasting response to a prenatal immune-related insult.
METHODS: Transcript levels for NF-κB pathway markers were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the prefrontal cortex from 1) 62 matched pairs of schizophrenia and unaffected comparison subjects, 2) antipsychotic-exposed monkeys, and 3) adult mice exposed prenatally to maternal immune activation or in adulthood to the immune stimulant polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid.
RESULTS: In schizophrenia subjects, but not antipsychotic-exposed monkeys, we found higher messenger RNA levels for 1) most NF-κB family members, 2) all NF-κB activation receptors, 3) several kinases, and 4) one inhibitor (IκBα) whose transcript level is itself regulated by NF-κB activity. A similar pattern of elevated NF-κB-related messenger RNA levels was seen in adult mice that received daily polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid injections, but not in adult mice subjected to maternal immune activation in utero.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher NF-κB activity, evidenced by elevated transcript levels for NF-κB family members, activation receptors, and kinases, may contribute to increased markers of cortical immune activation in schizophrenia.},

We used immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy to measure DSD and MAP2-IR in A1 deep layer 3. Consistent with previous studies, both DSD and MAP2-IR were lower in SZ subjects. We then tested the hypothesis that MAP2-IR mediates the effect of SZ on DSD in a cohort of 45 SZ-NPC subject pairs (combined cohort) that included all subjects from cohort 1 and two previously studied cohorts. Based on the distribution of MAP2-IR values in NPC subjects, we categorized each SZ subject as having either low MAP2-IR (SZ MAP2-IR(low)) or normal MAP2-IR (SZ MAP2-IR(normal)). Among SZ MAP-IR(low) subjects, mean DSD was significantly lower than in NPC subjects. However, mean DSD did not differ between SZ MAP2-IR(normal) and NPC subjects. Moreover, MAP2-IR statistically mediated small spine differences, with lower MAP2-IR values associated with fewer small spines. Our findings confirm that low density of small spines and low MAP2-IR are robust SZ phenotypes and suggest that MAP2-IR mediates the effect of SZ on DSD.},

Specifically, we demonstrated the involvement of STEP in A2AR-mediated cocaine effects in the striatum and, more recently, we found that in the rat striatum and hippocampus, as well as in a neuroblastoma cell line, the overexpression of the A2AR, or its stimulation, results in an increase in STEP activity. In the present article we will discuss the functional implication of this interaction, trying to examine the possible mechanisms involved in this relation between STEP and A2ARs.},

However, cancers are not single disease entities, but comprising multiple molecularly distinct subtypes, and the heterogeneity nature prevents precise selection of patients for optimized therapy. Dissecting cancer subtype-specific signaling pathways is crucial to pinpointing dysregulated genes for the prioritization of novel therapeutic targets. Nested effects models (NEMs) are a group of graphical models that encode subset relations between observed downstream effects under perturbations to upstream signaling genes, providing a prototype for mapping the inner workings of the cell. In this study, we developed NEM-Tar, which extends the original NEMs to predict drug targets by incorporating causal information of (epi)genetic aberrations for signaling pathway inference. An information theory-based score, weighted information gain (WIG), was proposed to assess the impact of signaling genes on a specific downstream biological process of interest. Subsequently, we conducted simulation studies to compare three inference methods and found that the greedy hill-climbing algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy and robustness to noise. Furthermore, two case studies were conducted using multi-omics data for colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC) in the TCGA database. Using NEM-Tar, we inferred signaling networks driving the poor-prognosis subtypes of CRC and GC, respectively. Our model prioritized not only potential individual drug targets such as HER2, for which FDA-approved inhibitors are available but also the combinations of multiple targets potentially useful for the design of combination therapies.},

There has been confusion regarding how to interpret undirected edges in essential graphs, however. In particular, experts and non-experts both have difficulty quantifying the likelihood of uncertain causal arrows being pointed in one direction or another. A simple interpretation of undirected edges treats them as having equal odds of being oriented in either direction, but I show in this paper that any agent interpreting undirected edges in this simple way can be Dutch booked. In other words, I can construct a set of bets that appears rational for the users of the simple interpretation to accept, but for which in all possible outcomes they lose money. I put forward another interpretation, prove this interpretation leads to a bet-taking strategy that is sufficient to avoid all Dutch books of this kind, and conjecture that this strategy is also necessary for avoiding such Dutch books. Finally, I demonstrate that undirected edges that are more likely to be oriented in one direction than the other are common in graphs with 4 nodes and 3 edges.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Linear regression models are important tools for learning regulatory networks from gene expression time series. A conventional assumption for non-homogeneous regulatory processes on a short time scale is that the network structure stays constant across time, while the network parameters are time-dependent. The objective is then to learn the network structure along with changepoints that divide the time series into time segments. An uncoupled model learns the parameters separately for each segment, while a coupled model enforces the parameters of any segment to stay similar to those of the previous segment. In this paper, we propose a new consensus model that infers for each individual time segment whether it is coupled to (or uncoupled from) the previous segment.
RESULTS: The results show that the new consensus model is superior to the uncoupled and the coupled model, as well as superior to a recently proposed generalized coupled model.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly proposed model has the uncoupled and the coupled model as limiting cases, and it is able to infer the best trade-off between them from the data.},

To systematically characterize dynamic, energetic and network signatures of the activation mechanisms, we combined atomistic simulations and elastic network modeling with the analysis of the residue interaction networks and rigidity decomposition of the CDK2-cyclin A and CDK4-cyclin D1/D3 complexes. The results of this study show that divergences in the activation mechanisms of CDK2 and CDK4 may be determined by differences in stabilization and allosteric cooperativity of the regulatory regions. We show that differential stabilization of the kinase lobes in the CDK4-cyclin D complexes caused by the elevated mobility of the N-lobe residues can weaken allosteric interactions between regulatory regions and compromise cooperativity of the inter-lobe motions that is required to trigger activating transitions. Network modelling and percolation analysis were used to emulate thermal unfolding and perform decomposition of rigid and flexible regions in the CDK2 and CDK4 complexes. These simulations showed that the percolation phase transition in the CDK2-cyclin A complexes is highly cooperative and driven by allosteric coupling between functional regions from both kinase lobes. In contrast, the imbalances in the distribution of rigid and flexible regions for the CDK4-cyclin D complexes, which are manifested by the intrinsic instability of the N-lobe, may weaken allosteric interactions and preclude productive activation. The results of this integrative computational study offer a simple and robust network-based model that explains regulatory divergences between CDK2 and CDK4 kinases.},

Atomistic modeling of the ABL complexes with a panel of allosteric modulators has been performed using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, structural residue perturbation scanning, and a novel community analysis of the residue interaction networks. Our results have indicated that allosteric inhibitors and activators may exert a differential control on allosteric signaling between the kinase binding sites and functional regions. While the inhibitor binding can strengthen the closed ABL state and induce allosteric communications directed from the allosteric pocket to the ATP binding site, the DPH activator may induce a more dynamic open form and activate allosteric couplings between the ATP and substrate binding sites. By leveraging a network-centric theoretical framework, we have introduced a novel community analysis method and global topological parameters that have unveiled the hierarchical modularity and the intercommunity bridging sites in the residue interaction network. We have found that allosteric functional hotspots responsible for the kinase regulation may serve the intermodular bridges in the global interaction network. The central conclusion from this analysis is that the regulatory switch centers play a fundamental role in the modular network organization of ABL as the unique intercommunity bridges that connect the SH2 and SH3 domains with the catalytic core into a functional kinase assembly. The hierarchy of network organization in the ABL regulatory complexes may allow for the synergistic action of dense intercommunity links required for the robust signal transfer in the catalytic core and sparse network bridges acting as the regulatory control points that orchestrate allosteric transitions between the inhibited and active kinase forms.},

Identification of the phosphorylation site-specific kinase-substrate relationships (ssKSRs) is important for understanding cellular dynamics and provides a fundamental basis for further disease-related research and drug design. Although several computational methods have been developed, most of these methods mainly use local sequence of phosphorylation sites and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to construct the prediction model. While phosphorylation presents very complicated processes and is usually involved in various biological mechanisms, the aforementioned information is not sufficient for accurate prediction. In this study, we propose a new and powerful computational approach named KSRPred for ssKSRs prediction, by introducing a novel phosphorylation site-kinase network (pSKN) profiles that can efficiently incorporate the relationships between various protein kinases and phosphorylation sites. The experimental results show that the pSKN profiles can efficiently improve the prediction performance in collaboration with local sequence and PPI information. Furthermore, we compare our method with the existing ssKSRs prediction tools and the results demonstrate that KSRPred can significantly improve the prediction performance compared with existing tools.},

With the advent of high throughput technologies, more comprehensive multi-omics data is now available that can effectively link the genotype to phenotype. However, the interactive relation of multi-omics datasets makes it particularly challenging to incorporate different biological layers to discover the coherent biological signatures and predict phenotypic outcomes. In this study, we introduce omicsGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to integrate two omics data and their interaction network. The model captures information from the interaction network as well as the two omics datasets and fuse them to generate synthetic data with better predictive signals. Large-scale experiments on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer and ovarian cancer datasets validate that (1) the model can effectively integrate two omics data (i.e., mRNA and microRNA expression data) and their interaction network (i.e., microRNA-mRNA interaction network). The synthetic omics data generated by the proposed model has a better performance on cancer outcome classification and patients survival prediction compared to original omics datasets. (2) The integrity of the interaction network plays a vital role in the generation of synthetic data with higher predictive quality. Using a random interaction network does not allow the framework to learn meaningful information from the omics datasets; therefore, results in synthetic data with weaker predictive signals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the limited availability of biological samples from different disease stages is a major hurdle in studying disease progressions and identifying early pathological changes. Deep learning techniques have recently begun to be applied to analyze NGS data and thereby predict the progression of biological processes. In this study, we applied a deep learning technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict the molecular progress of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We successfully applied GANs to analyze RNA-seq data from a 5xFAD mouse model of AD, which recapitulates major AD features of massive amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain. We examined how the generator is featured to have specific-sample generation and biological gene association. Based on the above observations, we suggested virtual disease progress by latent space interpolation to yield the transition curves of various genes with pathological changes from normal to AD state. By performing pathway analysis based on the transition curve patterns, we identified several pathological processes with progressive changes, such as inflammatory systems and synapse functions, which have previously been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Interestingly, our analysis indicates that alteration of cholesterol biosynthesis begins at a very early stage of AD, suggesting that it is the first effect to mediate the cholesterol metabolism of AD downstream of Aβ accumulation. Here, we suggest that GANs are a useful tool to study disease progression, leading to the identification of early pathological signatures.},

As more data is produced there is an increasing need to integrate diverse datasets and better analyse underutilised data to gain biological insights. However, analysis of single cell RNA-seq data is challenging due to biological and technical noise which not only varies between laboratories but also between batches. Here for the first time, we apply a new generative deep learning approach called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to biological data. We apply GANs to epidermal, neural and hematopoietic scRNA-seq data spanning different labs and experimental protocols. We show that it is possible to integrate diverse scRNA-seq datasets and in doing so, our generative model is able to simulate realistic scRNA-seq data that covers the full diversity of cell types. In contrast to many machine-learning approaches, we are able to interpret internal parameters in a biologically meaningful manner. Using our generative model we are able to obtain a universal representation of epidermal differentiation and use this to predict the effect of cell state perturbations on gene expression at high time-resolution. We show that our trained neural networks identify biological state-determining genes and through analysis of these networks we can obtain inferred gene regulatory relationships. Finally, we use internal GAN learned features to perform dimensionality reduction.

Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

Increasing evidence indicates that AD develops from an intricate web of biochemical and cellular processes that extend far beyond amyloid and tau accumulation. This growing recognition surrounding the diversity of AD pathophysiology underscores the need for holistic systems-based approaches to explore AD pathogenesis. Here we describe how network-based proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool and how its application to the AD brain has provided an informative framework for the complex protein pathophysiology underlying the disease. Furthermore, we outline how the AD brain network proteome can be leveraged to advance additional scientific and translational efforts, including the discovery of novel protein biomarkers of disease.},

	abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the future challenges of meeting care demands for the growing number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States with a particular emphasis on primary care. By mid-century, the number of Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia may grow to 13.8 million. This represents a steep increase from the estimated 5.8 million Americans age 65 and older who have Alzheimer's dementia today. Official death certificates recorded 122,019 deaths from AD in 2018, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2018, deaths resulting from stroke, HIV and heart disease decreased, whereas reported deaths from Alzheimer's increased 146.2\%. In 2019, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.6 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at nearly \$244 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2020 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be \$305 billion. As the population of Americans living with Alzheimer's dementia increases, the burden of caring for that population also increases. These challenges are exacerbated by a shortage of dementia care specialists, which places an increasing burden on primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide care for people living with dementia. Many PCPs feel underprepared and inadequately trained to handle dementia care responsibilities effectively. This report includes recommendations for maximizing quality care in the face of the shortage of specialists and training challenges in primary care.},

	abstract = {Phiel et al. discovered that lithium blocked the production of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) peptides by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3α (GSK-3α) activity, opening the door to a new class of therapies for Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid plaques, which are primarily composed of Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregates, and neurofibrillary tangles are two of the pathophysiological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Phiel et al. investigated the possible involvement of GSK-3, which may contribute to the development of neurofibrillary tangles, in the production of Aβ, a process that depends on the sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Lithium, which inhibits GSK-3α and GSK-3β, reduced secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing APP without affecting steady-state levels of APP. Analysis of processing intermediates indicated that lithium inhibited APP processing at or before proteolysis by γ-secretase (which is involved in processing Notch as well as APP). Lithium did not affect Notch processing. Pharmacologic analysis, combined with manipulation of GSK-3α and GSK-3β levels through RNA interference and GSK-3α overexpression, indicated that lithium's inhibition of APP processing was mediated through GSK-3α. Therapeutic doses of lithium also reduced tissue levels of Aβ in a mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease. Because lithium inhibits the formation of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and apparently spares Notch processing, unlike other agents that affect γ-secretase cleavage of APP, these data suggest that GSK-3α inhibitors may have a role in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease. De Strooper and Woodgett discuss the background and implications of this research.

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is associated with increased production and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Abeta peptides are derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential proteolysis, catalysed by the aspartyl protease BACE, followed by presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase cleavage. Presenilin interacts with nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2 (ref. 6), all of which are required for gamma-secretase function. Presenilins also interact with alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), but a functional role for these proteins in gamma-secretase activity has not been established. Here we show that therapeutic concentrations of lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, block the production of Abeta peptides by interfering with APP cleavage at the gamma-secretase step, but do not inhibit Notch processing. Importantly, lithium also blocks the accumulation of Abeta peptides in the brains of mice that overproduce APP. The target of lithium in this setting is GSK-3alpha, which is required for maximal processing of APP. Since GSK-3 also phosphorylates tau protein, the principal component of neurofibrillary tangles, inhibition of GSK-3alpha offers a new approach to reduce the formation of both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.},

is a well-established therapeutic option for the acute
and long-term management of bipolar disorder and major depression.
More recently, based on findings from translational research, lithium
has also been regarded as a neuroprotective agent and a candidate
drug for disease-modification in certain neurodegenerative disorders,
namely, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), and, more recently, Parkinson’s disease (PD). The putative
neuroprotective effects of lithium rely on the fact that it modulates
several homeostatic mechanisms involved in neurotrophic response,
autophagy, oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial function.
Such a wide range of intracellular responses may be secondary to two
key effects, that is, the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3
beta (GSK-3β) and inositol monophosphatase (IMP) by lithium.
In the present review, we revisit the neurobiological properties of
lithium in light of the available evidence of its neurotrophic and
neuroprotective properties, and discuss the rationale for its use
in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Abnormalities in kinase-mediated signaling are involved in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we expand on the hypothesis that kinase networks are dysregulated in schizophrenia. We investigated changes in serine/threonine kinase activity in cortical excitatory neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a schizophrenia patient presenting with a 4 bp mutation in the disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene and a corresponding control. Using kinome peptide arrays, we demonstrate large scale abnormalities in DISC1 cells, including a global depression of serine/threonine kinase activity, and changes in activity of kinases, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and thousand-and-one amino acid (TAO) kinases. Using isogenic cell lines in which the DISC1 mutation is either introduced in the control cell line, or rescued in the schizophrenia cell line, we ascribe most of these changes to a direct effect of the presence of the DISC1 mutation. Investigating the gene expression signatures downstream of the DISC1 kinase network, and mapping them on perturbagen signatures obtained from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) database, allowed us to propose novel drug targets able to reverse the DISC1 kinase dysregulation gene expression signature. Altogether, our findings provide new insight into abnormalities of kinase networks in schizophrenia and suggest possible targets for disease intervention.},

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by disruptions of brain cell metabolism, microstructure, and neurotransmission. All of these processes require coordination of multiple kinase-mediated signaling events. We hypothesize that imbalances in kinase activity propagate through an interconnected network of intracellular signaling with potential to simultaneously contribute to many or all of the observed deficits in schizophrenia. We established a workflow distinguishing schizophrenia-altered kinases in anterior cingulate cortex using a previously published kinome array data set. We compared schizophrenia-altered kinases to haloperidol-altered kinases, and identified systems, functions, and regulators predicted using pathway analyses. We used kinase inhibitors with the kinome array to test hypotheses about imbalance in signaling and conducted preliminary studies of kinase proteins, phosphoproteins, and activity for kinases of interest. We investigated schizophrenia-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in one of these kinases, AKT, for genotype-dependent changes in AKT protein or activity. Kinome analyses identified new kinases as well as some previously implicated in schizophrenia. These results were not explained by chronic antipsychotic treatment. Kinases identified in our analyses aligned with cytoskeletal arrangement and molecular trafficking. Of the kinases we investigated further, AKT and (unexpectedly) JNK, showed the most dysregulation in the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenia subjects. Changes in kinase activity did not correspond to protein or phosphoprotein levels. We also show that AKT single nucleotide polymorphism rs1130214, previously associated with schizophrenia, influenced enzyme activity but not protein or phosphoprotein levels. Our data indicate subtle changes in kinase activity and regulation across an interlinked kinase network, suggesting signaling imbalances underlie the core symptoms of schizophrenia.
DISEASE MECHANISMS: A SIGNALING IMBALANCE: A study by US scientists indicates that changes in the activity of key signaling proteins may underlie core symptoms of schizophrenia. Protein kinases mediate the activation of intracellular signaling events and analyses of the kinome, the complete set of protein kinases encoded in the genome, previously revealed significant changes in phosphorylation patterns in postmortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia. Based on these findings, Jennifer McGuire at the University of Cincinnati and colleagues investigated the upstream regulation of these proteins. They identified both established and novel proteins associated with schizophrenia in the anterior cingulate cortex, with JNK and AKT activity being the most disrupted in schizophrenia patients. Their findings highlight how subtle changes in the activity of a small number of signaling proteins can propagate and have major consequences for mental health.},

Patient-derived NRXN1+/- hiPSC-neurons show a greater than twofold reduction in half of the wild-type NRXN1α isoforms and express dozens of novel isoforms from the mutant allele. Reduced neuronal activity in patient-derived NRXN1+/- hiPSC-neurons is ameliorated by overexpression of individual control isoforms in a genotype-dependent manner, whereas individual mutant isoforms decrease neuronal activity levels in control hiPSC-neurons. In a genotype-dependent manner, the phenotypic impact of patient-specific NRXN1+/- mutations can occur through a reduction in wild-type NRXN1α isoform levels as well as the presence of mutant NRXN1α isoforms.},

By integrating CRISPR-mediated gene editing, activation and repression technologies to study one putative SZ eQTL (FURIN rs4702) and four top-ranked SZ eQTL genes (FURIN, SNAP91, TSNARE1 and CLCN3), our platform resolves pre- and postsynaptic neuronal deficits, recapitulates genotype-dependent gene expression differences and identifies convergence downstream of SZ eQTL gene perturbations. Our observations highlight the cell-type-specific effects of common variants and demonstrate a synergistic effect between SZ eQTL genes that converges on synaptic function.

	abstract = {The astrocytic cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc- represents an important source of extracellular glutamate in the central nervous system, with potential impact on excitatory neurotransmission. Yet, its function and importance in brain physiology remain incompletely understood. Employing slice electrophysiology and mice with a genetic deletion of the specific subunit of system xc-, xCT (xCT-/- mice), we uncovered decreased neurotransmission at corticostriatal synapses. This effect was partly mitigated by replenishing extracellular glutamate levels, indicating a defect linked with decreased extracellular glutamate availability. We observed no changes in the morphology of striatal medium spiny neurons, the density of dendritic spines, or the density or ultrastructure of corticostriatal synapses, indicating that the observed functional defects are not due to morphological or structural abnormalities. By combining electron microscopy with glutamate immunogold labeling, we identified decreased intracellular glutamate density in presynaptic terminals, presynaptic mitochondria, and in dendritic spines of xCT-/- mice. A proteomic and kinomic screen of the striatum of xCT-/- mice revealed decreased expression of presynaptic proteins and abnormal kinase network signaling, that may contribute to the observed changes in postsynaptic responses. Finally, these corticostriatal deregulations resulted in a behavioral phenotype suggestive of autism spectrum disorder in the xCT-/- mice; in tests sensitive to corticostriatal functioning we recorded increased repetitive digging behavior and decreased sociability. To conclude, our findings show that system xc- plays a previously unrecognized role in regulating corticostriatal neurotransmission and influences social preference and repetitive behavior.},

	abstract = {Protein kinases play a predominant regulatory role in nearly every aspect of cell biology and they can modify the function of a protein in almost every conceivable way. Protein phosphorylation can increase or decrease enzyme activity and it can alter other biological activities such as transcription and translation. Moreover, some phosphorylation sites on a given protein are stimulatory while others are inhibitory. The human protein kinase gene family consists of 518 members along with 106 pseudogenes. Furthermore, about 50 of the 518 gene products lack important catalytic residues and are called protein pseudokinases. The non-catalytic allosteric interaction of protein kinases and pseudokinases with other proteins has added an important regulatory feature to the biochemistry and cell biology of the protein kinase superfamily. With rare exceptions, a divalent cation such as Mg2+ is required for the reaction. All protein kinases exist in a basal state and are activated only as necessary by divergent regulatory stimuli. The mechanisms for switching between dormant and active protein kinases can be intricate. Phosphorylase kinase was the first protein kinase to be characterized biochemically and the mechanism of its regulation led to the discovery of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, or PKA), which catalyzes the phosphorylation and activation of phosphorylase kinase. This was the first protein kinase cascade or signaling module to be elucidated. The epidermal growth factor receptor-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling module contains protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, and dual specificity protein kinases. PKA has served as a prototype of this enzyme family and more is known about this enzyme than any other protein kinase. The inactive PKA holoenzyme consists of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. After binding four molecules of cAMP, the holoenzyme dissociates into a regulatory subunit dimer (each monomer binds two cAMP) and two free and active catalytic subunits. PKA and all other protein kinase domains have a small amino-terminal lobe and large carboxyterminal lobe as determined by X-ray crystallography. The N-lobe and C-lobe form a cleft that serves as a docking site for MgATP. Nearly all active protein kinases contain a K/E/D/D signature sequence that plays important structural and catalytic roles. Protein kinases contain hydrophobic catalytic and regulatory spines and collateral shell residues that are required to assemble the active enzyme. There are two general kinds of conformational changes associated with most protein kinases. The first conformational change involves the formation of an intact regulatory spine to form an active enzyme. The second conformational change occurs in active kinases as they toggle between open and closed conformations during their catalytic cycles. Because mutations and dysregulation of protein kinases play causal roles in human disease, this family of enzymes has become one of the most important drug targets over the past two decades. Imatinib was approved by the United States FDA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2001; this small molecule inhibits the BCR-Abl protein kinase oncoprotein that results from the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome. More than two dozen other orally effective mechanism-based small molecule protein kinase inhibitors have been subsequently approved by the FDA. These drugs bind to the ATP-binding site of their target enzymes and extend into nearby hydrophobic pockets. Most of these protein kinase inhibitors prolong survival in cancer patients only weeks or months longer than standard cytotoxic therapies. In contrast, the clinical effectiveness of imatinib against chronic myelogenous leukemia is vastly superior to that of any other targeted protein kinase inhibitor with overall survival lasting a decade or more. However, the near universal and expected development of drug resistance in the treatment of neoplastic disorders requires new approaches to solve this therapeutic challenge. Cancer is the predominant indication for these drugs, but disease targets are increasing. For example, we can expect the approval of new drugs inhibiting other protein kinases in the treatment of illnesses such as hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and autoimmune diseases.},

	abstract = {Owing to the dysregulation of protein kinase activity in many diseases including cancer, the protein kinase enzyme family has become one of the most important drug targets in the 21st century. There are 62 FDA-approved therapeutic agents that target about two dozen different protein kinases and eight of these were approved in 2020. All of the FDA-approved drugs are orally effective with the exception of netarsudil (a ROCK1/2 non-receptor protein-serine/threonine kinase antagonist given as an eye drop for the treatment of glaucoma) and temsirolimus (an indirect mTOR inhibitor given intravenously for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma). Of the approved drugs, ten target protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, four are directed against dual specificity protein kinases (MEK1/2), thirteen block non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 35 target receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 55 of these drugs are prescribed for the treatment of neoplasms (52 against solid tumors including breast, lung, and colon, nine against non-solid tumors such as leukemias, and four against both solid and non-solid tumors: acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, imatinib, and midostaurin). A total of three drugs (baricitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib) is used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Seven of the approved drugs form covalent bonds with their target enzymes and are classified as TCIs (targeted covalent inhibitors). Of the 62 approved drugs, eighteen are used in the treatment of multiple diseases. Imatinib, for example, is approved for the treatment of eight different disorders. The most common drug targets of the approved pharmaceuticals include BCR-Abl, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), and ALK. The following eight drugs received FDA approval in 2020 for the treatment of the specified diseases: avapritinib and ripretinib (gastrointestinal stromal tumors), capmatinib (non-small cell lung cancer), pemigatinib (cholangiocarcinoma), pralsetinib and selpercatinib (non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, differentiated thyroid cancer), selumetinib (neurofibromatosis type I), and tucatinib (HER2-positive breast cancer). All of the eight drugs approved in 2020 fulfill Lipinski's rule of five criteria for an orally effective medicine (MW of 500 Da or less, five or fewer hydrogen bond donors, 10 or fewer hydrogen bond acceptors, calculated log10 of the partition coefficient of five or less) with the exception of three drugs with a molecular weight greater that 500 Da: pralsetinib (534), selpercatinib (526) and ripretinib (510).

	abstract = {Since the first approval of a protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001, 55 new PKIs have reached the market, and many inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This is a clear indication that protein kinases still represent major drug targets for the pharmaceutical industry. In a previous work, we have introduced PKIDB, a publicly available database, gathering PKIs that have already been approved (Phase 4), as well as those currently in clinical trials (Phases 0 to 3). This database is updated frequently, and an analysis of the new data is presented here. In addition, we compared the set of PKIs present in PKIDB with the PKIs in early preclinical studies found in ChEMBL, the largest publicly available chemical database. For each dataset, the distribution of physicochemical descriptors related to drug-likeness is presented. From these results, updated guidelines to prioritize compounds for targeting protein kinases are proposed. The results of a principal component analysis (PCA) show that the PKIDB dataset is fully encompassed within all PKIs found in the public database. This observation is reinforced by a principal moments of inertia (PMI) analysis of all molecules. Interestingly, we notice that PKIs in clinical trials tend to explore new 3D chemical space. While a great majority of PKIs is located on the area of \&ldquo;flatland\&rdquo;, we find few compounds exploring the 3D structural space. Finally, a scaffold diversity analysis of the two datasets, based on frequency counts was performed. The results give insight into the chemical space of PKIs, and can guide researchers to reach out new unexplored areas.

	abstract = {The number of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) approved worldwide continues to grow steadily, with 39 drugs approved in the period between 2001 and January 2018. PKIs on the market have been the subject of many reviews, and structure-property relationships specific to this class of drugs have been inferred. However, the large number of PKIs under development is often overlooked. In this paper, we present PKIDB (Protein Kinase Inhibitor Database), a monthly-updated database gathering approved PKIs as well as PKIs currently in clinical trials. The database compiles currently 180 inhibitors ranging from phase 0 to 4 clinical trials along with annotations extracted from seven public resources. The distribution and property ranges of standard physicochemical properties are presented. They can be used as filters to better prioritize compound selection for future screening campaigns. Interestingly, more than one-third of the kinase inhibitors violate at least one Lipinski's rule. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals that Type-II inhibitors are mapped to a distinct chemical space as compared to orally administrated drugs as well as to other types of kinase inhibitors. Using a Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) analysis, we show that PKIs under development tend to explore new shape territories as compared to approved PKIs. In order to facilitate the analysis of the protein space, the kinome tree has been annotated with all protein kinases being targeted by PKIs. Finally, we analyzed the pipeline of the pharmaceutical companies having PKIs on the market or still under development. We hope that this work will assist researchers in the kinase field in identifying and designing the next generation of kinase inhibitors for still untargeted kinases.

Of the 48 approved drugs, the majority (25) target receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, ten target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 13 target protein-serine/threonine protein kinases. The data indicate that 43 of these drugs are used in the treatment of malignancies (36 against solid tumors including lymphomas and seven against non-solid tumors, e.g., leukemias). Seven drugs are used in the treatment of non-malignancies: baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; netarsudil, glaucoma; tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, ibrutinib and sirolimus are used for the treatment of both malignant and non-malignant diseases. The most common drug targets include ALK, B-Raf, BCR-Abl, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Most of the small molecule inhibitors (45) interact directly with the protein kinase domain. In contrast, sirolimus, temsirolimus, and everolimus are larger molecules (MW ≈ 1000) that bind to FKBP-12 to generate a complex that inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). This review presents the available drug-enzyme X-ray crystal structures for 27 of the approved drugs as well as the chemical structures and physicochemical properties of all of the FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase antagonists. Six of the drugs bind covalently and irreversibly to their target. Twenty of the 48 drugs have molecular weights greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular weight of drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib). Nearly half of the antagonists (23) have a lipophilic efficiency with values of less than five while the recommended optima range from 5-10.

	abstract = {Because genetic alterations including mutations, overexpression, translocations, and dysregulation of protein kinases are involved in the pathogenesis of many illnesses, this enzyme family is currently the subject of many drug discovery programs in the pharmaceutical industry. The US FDA approved four small molecule protein kinase antagonists in 2019; these include entrectinib, erdafitinib, pexidartinib, and fedratinib. Entrectinib binds to TRKA/B/C and ROS1 and is prescribed for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK fusion proteins and for ROS1-postive non-small cell lung cancers. Erdafitinib inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4 and is used in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancers. Pexidartinib is a CSF1R antagonist that is prescribed for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumors. Fedratinib blocks JAK2 and is used in the treatment of myelofibrosis. Overall, the US FDA has approved 52 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of temsirolimus (which is given intravenously) and netarsudil (an eye drop). Of the 52 approved drugs, eleven inhibit protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, two are directed against dual specificity protein kinases, eleven target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 28 block receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 46 of these drugs are used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases (eight against non-solid tumors such as leukemias and 41 against solid tumors including breast and lung cancers; some drugs are used against both tumor types). Eight drugs are employed in the treatment of non-malignancies: fedratinib, myelofibrosis; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; netarsudil, glaucoma; and tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, sirolimus and ibrutinib are used for the treatment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Entrectinib and larotrectinib are tissue-agnostic anti-cancer small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. These drugs are prescribed for the treatment of any solid cancer harboring NTRK1/2/3 fusion proteins regardless of the organ, tissue, anatomical location, or histology type. Of the 52 approved drugs, seventeen are used in the treatment of more than one disease. Imatinib, for example, is approved for the treatment of eight disparate disorders. The most common drug targets of the approved pharmaceuticals include BCR-Abl, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), and ALK.

Twenty-two of the 52 drugs have molecular weights greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular weight of the approved drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib). More than half of the antagonists (29) have lipophilic efficiency values of less than five while the recommended optima range from 5 to 10. One of the troublesome problems with both targeted and cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of malignant diseases is the near universal development of resistance to every therapeutic modality.},

	abstract = {Amplification or overexpression of the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases occurs in a significant proportion of gastric cancers. Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor of angiogenic and oncogenic kinases, including FGFR, which showed activity in the randomized phase II INTEGRATE clinical trial in advanced gastric cancer. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to this agent, and whether regorafenib is preferentially active in FGFR-driven cancers is unknown. Through screening 25 gastric cancer cell lines, we identified five cell lines that were exquisitely sensitive to regorafenib, four of which harbored amplification or overexpression of FGFR family members. These four cell lines were also sensitive to the FGFR-specific inhibitors, BGJ398, erdafitinib, and TAS-120. Regorafenib inhibited FGFR-driven MAPK signaling in these cell lines, and knockdown studies confirmed their dependence on specific FGFRs for proliferation. In the INTEGRATE trial cohort, amplification or overexpression of FGFRs 1–4 was detected in 8\%–19\% of cases, however, this was not associated with improved progression-free survival and no objective responses were observed in these cases. Further preclinical analyses revealed FGFR-driven gastric cancer cell lines rapidly reactivate MAPK/ERK signaling in response to FGFR inhibition, which may underlie the limited clinical response to regorafenib. Importantly, combination treatment with an FGFR and MEK inhibitor delayed MAPK/ERK reactivation and synergistically inhibited proliferation of FGFR-driven gastric cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that upfront combinatorial inhibition of FGFR and MEK may represent a more effective treatment strategy for FGFR-driven gastric cancers.},

The determining factors for the limited efficacy of FGFR-targeted therapy remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed kinome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screens in FGFR1-amplified lung cancer cells treated with an FGFR inhibitor. These screens identified PLK1 as a potent synthetic lethal target that mediates a resistance mechanism by overriding DNA damage and cell cycle arrest upon FGFR1 inhibition. Genetic and pharmacological antagonism of PLK1 in combination with FGFR inhibitor therapy synergized to enhance anti-proliferative effects and drove cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo through activation of the γH2AX-CHK-E2F1 axis. These findings suggest a previously unappreciated role for PLK1 in modulating FGFR1 inhibitor sensitivity and demonstrate a synergistic drug combination for treating FGFR1-amplified lung cancer.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dysfunction in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling has been reported in diverse cancer types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The frequency of FGFR aberrations in Chinese NSCLC patients is therefore of great clinical significance.
METHODS: A total of 10,966 NSCLC patients whose tumor specimen and/or circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) underwent hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing were reviewed. Patients' clinical characteristics and treatment histories were also evaluated.
RESULTS: FGFR aberrations, including mutations, fusions, and gene amplifications, were detected in 1.9\% (210/10,966) of the population. FGFR abnormalities were more frequently observed in lung squamous cell carcinomas (6.8\%, 65/954) than lung adenocarcinomas (1.3\%, 128/9,596). FGFR oncogenic mutations were identified in 19 patients ({\textasciitilde}0.17\%), of which, 68\% were male lung squamous cell carcinoma patients. Eleven out of the 19 patients (58\%) had concurrent altered PI3K signaling, thus highlighting a potential combination therapeutic strategy of dual-targeting FGFR and PI3K signaling in such patients. Furthermore, FGFR fusions retaining the intact kinase domain were identified in 12 patients (0.11\%), including 9 FGFR3-TACC3, 1 FGFR2-INA, 1 novel FGFR4-RAPGEFL1, and 1 novel fusion between the FGFR1 and SLC20A2 5'-untranslated regions, which may have caused FGFR1 overexpressions. Concomitant EGFR mutations or amplifications were observed in 6 patients, and 4 patients received anti-EGFR inhibitors, in whom FGFR fusions may have mediated resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. FGFR amplification was detected in 24 patients, with the majority being FGFR1 amplifications. Importantly, FGFR oncogenic mutations, fusions, and gene amplifications were almost always mutually exclusive events.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the prevalence of FGFR anomalies in a large NSCLC population, including mutations, gene amplifications, and novel FGFR fusions.},

Despite recent advances in medical oncology, the prognosis of CCA patients with metastatic disease remains poor, with a median overall survival of less than a year. In the last decade, notable efforts have been made by the CCA medical community in an attempt to improve clinical outcomes of patients, with the development of molecularly targeted therapies in this setting. Among these treatments, the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 inhibitor pemigatinib has received accelerated approval in April 2020 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in CCA patients harboring FGFR2 gene fusions or other rearrangements, on the basis of the results of the FIGHT-202 trial, and thus, representing the first molecularly targeted therapy to be approved for the treatment of CCA. However, several issues remain, including the emergence of polyclonal mutations determining resistance to pemigatinib, the identification of biomarkers predictive of response, and the knowledge gaps regarding the role of other FGFR gene aberrations. This review aims to provide an overview of recent development of pemigatinib, especially focusing on the results of the pivotal FIGHT-202 trial, the approval of this FGFR inhibitor, and the future challenges concerning the use of FGFR-directed treatments in CCA patients.},

	abstract = {The signaling component of the mammalian Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family is comprised of eighteen secreted proteins that interact with four signaling tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs). Interaction of FGF ligands with their signaling receptors is regulated by protein or proteoglycan cofactors and by extracellular binding proteins. Activated FGFRs phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues that mediate interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins and the RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, PLCγ, and STAT intracellular signaling pathways. Four structurally related intracellular non-signaling FGFs interact with and regulate the family of voltage gated sodium channels. Members of the FGF family function in the earliest stages of embryonic development and during organogenesis to maintain progenitor cells and mediate their growth, differentiation, survival, and patterning. FGFs also have roles in adult tissues where they mediate metabolic functions, tissue repair, and regeneration, often by reactivating developmental signaling pathways. Consistent with the presence of FGFs in almost all tissues and organs, aberrant activity of the pathway is associated with developmental defects that disrupt organogenesis, impair the response to injury, and result in metabolic disorders, and cancer.

Experiments in model systems have shown that FGFR-specific inhibitors may be valuable in treating multiple myeloma, bladder and endometrial cancers.FGF1, FGF2 and FGF4 have been studied in clinical trials for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The results of most of these trials have been unclear. However, some promising prospects remain. In particular, plasmids encoding FGF1 have shown potential in treating peripheral ischaemia.Recombinant FGF7 is Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis. Research into the application of FGF7 to treat conditions such as graft-versus-host disease is ongoing.FGF18 increases cartilage formation in rats and may be useful in treating osteoarthritis.The endocrine FGF19 subfamily holds the greatest promise for therapeutic development. These ligands circulate throughout the body owing to weak affinity for HSGAG (heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan), and they require α-klotho–β-klotho proteins as cofactors for their activity. The α-klotho–β-klotho proteins also determine the target-tissue specificity of FGF19 subfamily ligands.FGF19 negatively regulates bile acid synthesis and recombinant FGF19 increases the metabolic rate of mice. Unfortunately, FGF19 transgenic mice develop hepatocellular carcinomas, and this side effect may impede the pharmaceutical development of FGF19.FGF21 is a mediator of the fasting response that increases glucose uptake, improves insulin sensitivity and reduces serum glucagon and triglyceride levels.In contrast to FGF19, FGF21 is not mitogenic, and FGF21 administration leads to neither oedema nor hypoglycaemia, which are two common side effects of agents that modulate metabolic disorders. FGF21 thus shows great potential for treating type 2 diabetes.FGF23 reduces renal phosphate reabsorption and downregulates vitamin D activation. FGF23 is broadly implicated in human disease, including autosomal-dominant hypophosphataemic rickets, tumour-induced osteomalacia, familial tumoral calcinosis and end-stage kidney disease. Neutralizing antibodies against FGF23 have shown efficacy in model systems and demonstrate the clinical potential of FGF23-specific therapies.},

FGFs function via their high-affinity interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases, FGFR1-4. Expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in prostate cancer (CaP) was not found to be associated with clinical parameters. In this report, we further investigated for abnormal FGFR expression in prostate cancer and explore their significance as a potential target for therapy. The expression levels of FGFR3 and FGFR4 in CaP were examined and corroborated to clinical parameters. FGFR3 immunoreactivity in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and CaP (n=26 and 57, respectively) had similar intensity and pattern. Overall, FGFR4 expression was significantly upregulated in CaP when compared to BPH. A significant positive correlation between FGFR4 expression and Gleason score was noted: Gleason score 7-10 tumours compared to BPH (P{\textless}0.0001, Fisher's exact test), Gleason score 4-6 tumours compared to BPH (P{\textless}0.0004), and Gleason 7-10 compared to Gleason 4-6 tumours (P{\textless}0.005). FGFR4 overexpression was associated with an unfavourable outcome with decreased disease-specific survival (P{\textless}0.04, log rank test). FGF-induced signalling is targeted using soluble FGF receptor (sFGFR), potent inhibitor of FGFR function. We have previously shown that sFGFR expression via a replication-deficient adenoviral vector (AdlllcRl) suppresses in vitro FGF-induced signalling and function in human CaP DU145 cells. We tested the significance of inhibiting FGF function along with conventional therapeutic modalities in CaP, and confirmed synergistic effects on in vitro cell growth (proliferation and colony formation) by combining sFGFR expression and treatment with either Paclitaxel (Taxol) or gamma-irradiation.

	abstract = {Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) drive crucial developmental signalling pathways, which are responsible for many functions, including cell proliferation, survival and migration. As such, they are susceptible to hijack by cancer cells and have been shown to have oncogenic roles in many cancers.Conversely, FGFR signalling can also have tumour suppressive roles, through driving differentiation, regulating other oncogenic pathways, protecting cells from damage or perhaps by mediating immune surveillance.The specific cellular context in which FGF signalling occurs is clearly important for determining whether oncogenic or tumour protective outcomes are evoked, and understanding more about context-specific FGF signalling is a key area of research.There are several types of genetic evidence that support an oncogenic function for FGFRs: identification of gene amplifications, activating mutations, chromosomal translocations, single nucleotide polymorphisms and aberrant splicing at the post-transcriptional level. Expression of FGFs can also be affected by gene amplification.There is now evidence from multiple cancer types to implicate FGF signalling in several oncogenic behaviours, including proliferation, survival, migration, invasion and angiogenesis.Therapeutic targeting of FGFs and their receptors is a major area of drug development research. Most agents are small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but blocking antibodies and ligand-trap approaches are also being developed.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK153503/},
	abstract = {The cdc2-like (Clk) kinases are critical elements of several important regulatory pathways involving pre-mRNA splicing. These kinases act by phosphorylating the serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which direct the early events of spliceosome assembly necessary for proper mRNA maturation. Mutations causing splicing defects have been linked to a number of disease processes, making the search for small-molecule regulators of enzymes associated with spliceosome function important for both the further study and potential treatment of these disorders. The dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated (Dyrk) kinases are associated with numerous cellular processes and disorders. In particular, overexpression of Dyrk1A may contribute to Down syndrome neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and Dyrk1B/Mirk has been implicated in the cellular repair of cancer cells impaired by chemotherapy. Developing inhibitors of the Dyrk kinases would likely have important biochemical and therapeutic uses. Continuing in the search for selective inhibitors of Clk and Dyrk kinases, we now report a series of amino-substituted pyrimidines with excellent potencies against several Clk and Dyrk isoforms. The probe compound and its analogs have been subjected to Clk and Dyrk isoform selectivity profiling by Ambit Biosciences and three compounds have also been sent for KINOMEscan analysis to assess their selectivity in the context of the greater kinome. The reported compounds are low-nanomolar Clk and Dyrk inhibitors, with the most potent compound having IC50s {\textless}10 nM against Clk1, Clk4, Dyrk1A and Dyrk1B. The probe molecule (ML315) is a substituted aminopyrimidine and structurally distinct from previous quinazoline probes. ML315 should provide biochemical investigators with a new tool to be used in parallel with the quinazoline probes in efforts to determine which Clk and/or Dyrk isoforms are associated with particular biochemical events. Until isoform-selective inhibitors of each Clk and Dyrk kinase can be developed, parallel use of the available panel of inhibitors should enable biological investigations with these kinase families to proceed through a “process of elimination” approach.},

	abstract = {Protein kinases are key regulators of cellular signal transduction with crucial roles for healthy cell biology and pathogenesis. Accordingly many drugs have been developed to address the dysregulation of these enzymes, notably in oncology. Around 50 small molecule kinase inhibitors have already been approved, and hundreds of such drugs are the object of clinical investigation to combat these disease drivers with targeted therapeutic approaches. Due to the conserved structure of the kinase domain across the kinome, compounds may not only act on their intended targets but may also bind and inhibit other proteins. Thus, many kinase inhibitors display a promiscuous target profile that makes selectivity profiling indispensable in order to understand the positive and negative actions of the drugs regardless of their use as chemical probes or therapeutic agents. Chemical proteomics has developed into a powerful technique for investigating drug–protein interactions. One successful example is the Kinobeads technology that features broadly selective small molecule kinase inhibitors immobilized on sepharose beads for affinity enrichment of native kinases out of any tissue or cell lysates. Target deconvolution of kinase inhibitors is achieved through a competitive set-up in which the lysate is treated with increasing concentrations of an inhibitor of interest before affinity enrichment with the Kinobeads matrix. This results in a competition between the Kinobeads and the compound for the active sites of all targets present in the lysate. For each engaged target, reduced binding to Kinobeads ensues, leading to dose-dependent intensity reduction of the target peptides in the mass spectrometric read-out. Analysis of the many dose–response curves obtained helps to establish the target space of a molecule. In this chapter we describe the principle, experimental details, and applications of the Kinobeads technology. We first draw the reader's attention to the theoretical background and important points to consider when developing a chemical proteomics profiling assay. We then disclose our latest standard operating procedure to achieve a successful Kinobeads profiling assay. Next, we summarize representative application examples of the Kinobeads in different stages of the drug discovery pipeline for human and non-human proteomes. Finally we propose a perspective of the future opportunities of the Kinobeads approach in drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Biological matter is organized in functional networks of different natures among which kinase–substrate and protein–protein interactions play an important role. Large public data collections allowed us to compile an important corpus of interaction data around human protein kinases. One of the most interesting observations analyzing this network is that coherence in kinase functional activity relies on kinase substrate interactions primarily and not on which protein complexes are formed around them. Further dissecting the two types of interactions at the level of kinase groups (CMGCs, Tyrosine kinases, etc.) we show a prevalence of intra-group interconnectivity, which we can naturally relate to current scenarios of evolution of biological networks. Tracking publication dates we observe high correlation of kinase interaction research focus with general kinase research. We find a similar bias in the targets of kinase inhibitors that feature high redundancy. Finally, intersecting kinase inhibitor specificity with sets of kinases located at specific positions in the kinase network, we propose alternative options for future therapeutic strategies using these compounds.
Biological significance
Despite its importance for cellular regulation and the fact that protein kinases feature prominent targets of modern therapeutic approaches, the structure and logic of the global, integrated protein phosphorylation network have not been investigated intensively. To focus on the regulatory skeleton of the phosphorylation network, we contemplated a network consisting of kinases, their substrates, and publicly available physical protein interactions. Analysis of this network at multiple levels allowed establishing a series of interesting properties such as prevalence of kinase substrate interactions as opposed to general protein–protein interactions for establishing a holistic control over kinases activities. Kinases controlling many or a few only other kinases, in addition to non-kinases, were distributed in cellular compartments differently. They were also targeted by kinase inhibitors with distinct success rates. Non-kinases tightly regulated by a large number of kinases were involved in biological processes both specific and shared with their regulators while being preferably localized in the nucleus. Collectively, these observations may provide for a new perspective in the elaboration of pharmacological intervention strategies. We complemented our study of kinase interactions with a perspective of how this type of data is generated in comparison with general research about those enzymes. Namely, what was the temporal evolution of the research community attention for interaction versus non-interaction-based kinase experiments.

	abstract = {LONG-TERM potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is thought to contribute to memory formation. In the Ca1 region, LTP requires the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor-dependent influx of Ca2+ and activation of serine and threonine protein kinases. Because of the high amount of protein tyrosine kinases in hippocampus and cerebellum1,2, two regions implicated in learning and memory, we examined the possible additional requirement of tyrosine kinase activity in LTP. We first examined the specificity in brain of five inhibitors of tyrosine kinase3-5 (Table 1) and found that two of them, lavendustin A and genistein, showed substantially greater specificity for tyrosine kinase from hippocampus6 than for three serine-threonine kinases: protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II. Lavendustin A and genistein selectively blocked the induction of LTP when applied in the bath or injected into the postsynaptic cell. By contrast, the inhibitors had no effect on the established LTP, on normal synaptic transmission, or on the neurotransmitter actions attributable to the actions of protein kinase A or protein kinase C. These data suggest that tyrosine kinase activity could be required postsynaptically for long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. As Ca2+ cal-modulin kinase II or protein kinase C seem also to be required7, 8, the tyrosine kinases could participate postsynaptically in a kinase network together with serine and threonine kinases. © 1991 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Proline-directed kinases such as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3) have been implicated in the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Such aberrant phosphorylation of tau appears to compromise on its ability to bind to and stabilize microtubules, and this may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathology. In this review, the architecture of the intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate proline-directed kinases is described. The MAP kinases serve as major intersection points in the flow of information from a plethora of extracellular stimuli and affect diverse cellular processes that are often important for cell proliferation. Although brain contains terminally differentiated neurons, many of the known components of MAP kinase-dependent lines of communication are highly expressed in the nervous system. Similar signalling pathways may also regulate CDK5 and GSK3. In mitotic cells, abnormal activation of the protein kinase network at multiple points can contribute to oncogenic transformation. It is proposed that Alzheimer's disease may also result from accumulated defects in the kinase network that governs the proline-directed kinases such that their inappropriate activation is sustained in the affected neurons. A detailed understanding of proline-directed kinase-dependent pathways may permit the identification of rational targets for the therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. © 1995.},

	abstract = {The differences between the redox states of the NAD-and NADP-couples in the cytoplasm have been measured. The ratio [free NADP]/[free NADPH2] was found to be about 100,000 times smaller than the ratio [free NAD]/[NADH2]. These differences can be explained on the basis of simple physicochemical principles. They are essentially the result of thermodynamic equilibria. The position of these depends on the equilibrium constants of a number of highly active, readily reversible enzymes and the concentration of the substrates and products of these enzymes. The crucial feature is the fact that the NAD- and NADP-couples share substrates. This sharing represents links between the two couples in the cytoplasm and through these links the order of magnitude of the differences in the redox state is fixed. Analogous explanations can be visualized for the origin of the large differences between the redox states of the cytoplasm and mitochondrial NAD-couples but these involve assumptions regarding the distribution of metabolites between cytoplasm and mitochondria which can as yet not be reliably tested by experiment. There is a need for developing methods for measuring the distribution in situ. The redox states of the cytoplasmic pyridine nucleotide couples are also linked to the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotide, i.e., to the ratio [ATP]/[ADP] [Pi] of the cytoplasm, again by enzyme systems—the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase plus 3-phosphoglycerate kinase—which establish equilibria. There is thus a network of equilibria, or more correctly near-equilibria, which is ultimately regulated by the degree of phosphorylation of the adenine nucleotide system, i.e., by the respiratory chain: the cytoplasmic adenine nucleotide system is directly linked to the redox state of the cytoplasmic NAD-couple which in turn is linked to the redox state of the cytoplasmic NADP-couple and that of the two mitochondral couples. The network of near-equilibria in which the pyridine and adenine nucleotides participate is likely to be a fundamental component of the energy-transforming mechanisms in the liver cell. It establishes a basic level of the redox states of the two pyridine nucleotide couples in the two main cell compartments where the energy-transforming mechanisms are located and it links the redox states to the supply of ATP. It sets the cytoplasmic level of the NAD-couple to be suitable for both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. It sets the cytoplasmic redox state of the NADP-couple at a much more reduced level so as to be effective in reductive syntheses such as that of fatty acids, the redox potential being about 150 mV more negative than that of the NAD-couple. This network is one of thermodynamic equilibria whereas living cells, of course, do not represent equilibria but steady states. But the fact that thermodynamic equilibrium of a cell is synonymous with death does not imply that equilibria cannot play an important part in the organization of the chemical cell dynamics. Equilibria form a basic framework upon which virtually irreversible processes are superimposed. These flow through the equilibria, more or less upsetting them and modifying the strict equilibria to steady states. It is the flux through the network of equilibria which causes the degradation of food and the synthesis of the cell material—both processes which, as a whole, are irreversible. The framework of equilibria may be looked upon as a component of regulatory mechanisms: as irreversible processes flow through and mildly upset the equilibria, they automatically set in motion steps which reestablish the ‘resting’ state.},

This type of protein kinase was believed to be relatively nonspecific, but nonetheless favored as substrates those proteins having a high content of serine, often containing runs of four or more serines in a row. Protein kinases, possessing more discrete functions, have also been recognized and have generally been referred to based on the particular substrate on which they act. In this latter category are phosphorylase kinase, glycogen synthetase I kinase, histone kinase, protamine kinase, and pyruvic dehydrogenase kinase. Noteworthy of this latter group is their involvement in the regulation or control of various aspects of cellular function or metabolism.

Specification of neurites into dendrites is followed by their arborization, maturation, and functional integration into synaptic networks. Each of these distinct developmental processes is spatially and temporally controlled in an exquisite fashion. Protein kinases through their highly specific substrate phosphorylation regulate dendritic growth and plasticity. Perturbation of kinase function results in aberrant dendritic growth and synaptic function. Not surprisingly, kinase dysfunction is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Herein, we review, (a) key kinase pathways that regulate dendrite structure, function and plasticity, (b) how aberrant kinase signaling contributes to dendritic dysfunction in neurological disorders and (c) application of emergent technologies that can be applied to dissect the role of protein kinases in dendritic structure and function.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difficult malignancies to treat. Minimal improvements in patient outcomes and persistently abysmal patient survival rates underscore the great need for new treatment strategies. Currently, there is intense interest in therapeutic strategies that target tyrosine protein kinases. Here, we employed kinome arrays and bioinformatic pipelines capable of identifying differentially active protein tyrosine kinases in different patient-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines and wild-type pancreatic tissue to investigate the unique kinomic networks of PDAC samples and posit novel target kinases for pancreatic cancer therapy. Consistent with previously described reports, the resultant peptide-based kinome array profiles identified increased protein tyrosine kinase activity in pancreatic cancer for the following kinases: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 4/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (FLT4/VEGFR-3), insulin receptor (INSR), ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), SRC proto-oncogene kinase (SRC), and tyrosine kinase non receptor 2 (TNK2). Furthermore, this study identified increased activity for protein tyrosine kinases with limited prior evidence of differential activity in pancreatic cancer. These protein tyrosine kinases include B lymphoid kinase (BLK), Fyn-related kinase (FRK), Lck/Yes-related novel kinase (LYN), FYN proto-oncogene kinase (FYN), lymphocyte cell-specific kinase (LCK), tec protein kinase (TEC), hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK), ABL proto-oncogene 2 kinase (ABL2), discoidin domain receptor 1 kinase (DDR1), and ephrin receptor A8 kinase (EPHA8). Together, these results support the utility of peptide array kinomic analyses in the generation of potential candidate kinases for future pancreatic cancer therapeutic development.},

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), innovative pharmaceutical strategies such as kinase targeting have been unable to appreciably increase patient survival. This may be due, in part, to unchecked desmoplastic reactions to pancreatic tumors. Desmoplastic stroma enhances tumor development and progression while simultaneously restricting drug delivery to the tumor cells it protects. Emerging evidence indicates that many of the pathologic fibrotic processes directly or indirectly supporting desmoplasia may be driven by targetable protein tyrosine kinases such as Fyn-related kinase (FRK); B lymphoid kinase (BLK); hemopoietic cell kinase (HCK); ABL proto-oncogene 2 kinase (ABL2); discoidin domain receptor 1 kinase (DDR1); Lck/Yes-related novel kinase (LYN); ephrin receptor A8 kinase (EPHA8); FYN proto-oncogene kinase (FYN); lymphocyte cell-specific kinase (LCK); tec protein kinase (TEC).

The peptide arrays included either up to 140 serine/threonine-containing peptides or a concentration series of a smaller number of peptides. In comparison with existing singleplex assays, data quality was high, variation in assay conditions and reagent consumption were reduced considerably, and assay development could be accelerated because phosphorylation kinetics were monitored simultaneously on 4, 12, or 96 arrays. PKA was shown to phosphorylate many peptides containing known PKA phosphorylation sites as well as some new substrates. The kinetic behavior of the enzyme and the mechanism of inhibition by AMP-PNP, staurosporin, and PKA inhibitor peptide on the peptide microarray correlated well with data from homogeneous assays. Using this multiplex setup, we showed that the kinetic parameters of PKA and the potency of PKA inhibitors can be affected by the sequence of the peptide substrate. The technology enables kinetic monitoring of kinase activity in a multiplex setting such as a cell or tissue lysate. Finally, this high-throughput method allows fast identification of peptide substrates for serine/threonine kinases that are still uncharacterized. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) initiates signaling from several cytokine receptors and is required for biological responses such as erythropoiesis. JAK2 activity is controlled by regulatory proteins such as Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins and protein tyrosine phosphatases. JAK2 activity is also intrinsically controlled by regulatory domains, where the pseudokinase (JAK homology 2, JH2) domain has been shown to play an essential role. The physiological role of the JH2 domain in the regulation of JAK2 activity was highlighted by the discovery of the acquired missense point mutation V617F in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Hence, determining the precise role of this domain is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and design of new treatment modalities. Here, we have evaluated the effect of inter-domain interactions in kinase activity and substrate specificity. By using for the first time purified recombinant JAK2 proteins and a novel peptide micro-array platform, we have determined initial phosphorylation rates and peptide substrate preference for the recombinant kinase domain (JH1) of JAK2, and two constructs comprising both the kinase and pseudokinase domains (JH1-JH2) of JAK2. The data demonstrate that (i) JH2 drastically decreases the activity of the JAK2 JH1 domain, (ii) JH2 increased the K(m) for ATP (iii) JH2 modulates the peptide preference of JAK2 (iv) the V617F mutation partially releases this inhibitory mechanism but does not significantly affect substrate preference or K(m) for ATP. These results provide the biochemical basis for understanding the interaction between the kinase and the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 and identify a novel regulatory role for the JAK2 pseudokinase domain. Additionally, this method can be used to identify new regulatory mechanisms for protein kinases that provide a better platform for designing specific strategies for therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite significant recent efforts applied toward the development of efficacious therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) through exploration of GBM's genome and transcriptome, curative therapeutic strategies remain highly elusive. As such, novel and effective therapeutics are urgently required. In this study, the authors sought to explore the kinomic landscape of GBM from a previously underutilized approach (i.e., spatial heterogeneity), followed by validation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) targeting according to this stepwise kinomic-based novel approach.
METHODS: Twelve GBM tumor samples were obtained and characterized histopathologically from 2 patients with GBM. PamStation peptide-array analysis of these tissues was performed to measure the kinomic activity of each sample. The Ivy GBM database was then utilized to determine the intratumoral spatial localization of BTK activity by investigating the expression of BTK-related transcription factors (TFs) within tumors. Genetic inhibition of BTK family members through lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown was performed to determine their function in the core-like and edge-like GBM neurosphere models. Finally, the small-molecule inhibitor of BTK, ONO/GS-4059, which is currently under clinical investigation in nonbrain cancers, was applied for pharmacological inhibition of regionally specified newly established GBM edge and core neurosphere models.
RESULTS: Kinomic investigation identified two major subclusters of GBM tissues from both patients exhibiting distinct profiles of kinase activity. Comparatively, in these spatially defined subgroups, BTK was the centric kinase differentially expressed. According to the Ivy GBM database, BTK-related TFs were highly expressed in the tumor core, but not in edge counterparts. Short hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing of BTK in previously established edge- and core-like GBM neurospheres demonstrated increased apoptotic activity with predominance of the sub-G1 phase of core-like neurospheres compared to edge-like neurospheres. Lastly, pharmacological inhibition of BTK by ONO/GS-4059 resulted in growth inhibition of regionally derived GBM core cells and, to a lesser extent, their edge counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies significant heterogeneity in kinase activity both within and across distinct GBM tumors. The study findings indicate that BTK activity is elevated in the classically therapy-resistant GBM tumor core. Given these findings, targeting GBM's resistant core through BTK may potentially provide therapeutic benefit for patients with GBM.},

	abstract = {Background Many cancer patients do not obtain clinical benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition. Checkpoint blockade targets T cells, suggesting that tyrosine kinase activity profiling of baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells may predict clinical outcome.
Methods Here a total of 160 patients with advanced melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treated with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1), were divided into five discovery and cross-validation cohorts. The kinase activity profile was generated by analyzing phosphorylation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysates in a microarray comprising of 144 peptides derived from sites that are substrates for protein tyrosine kinases. Binary grouping into patients with or without clinical benefit was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors V.1.1. Predictive models were trained using partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), performance of the models was evaluated by estimating the correct classification rate (CCR) using cross-validation.
Results The kinase phosphorylation signatures segregated responders from non-responders by differences in canonical pathways governing T-cell migration, infiltration and co-stimulation. PLS-DA resulted in a CCR of 100\% and 93\% in the anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 melanoma discovery cohorts, respectively. Cross-validation cohorts to estimate the accuracy of the predictive models showed CCRs of 83\% for anti-CTLA-4 and 78\% or 68\% for anti-PD-1 in melanoma or NSCLC, respectively.
Conclusion Blood-based kinase activity profiling for response prediction to immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma and NSCLC revealed increased kinase activity in pathways associated with T-cell function and led to a classification model with a highly accurate classification rate in cross-validation groups. The predictive value of kinase activity profiling is prospectively verified in an ongoing trial.},

Methods: In a multi-center effort, data were prospectively collected from 6 cohorts of anti-CTLA4- or anti-PD1-treated advanced melanoma patients (n = 138). Kinase activity profiles were generated by analyzing phosphorylation signatures of PBMC lysates on a peptide micro-array. The PamChip (PamGene, Netherlands) microarray comprises 144 different peptides derived from protein phosphorylation sites that are substrates for protein tyrosine kinases. Performance of the predictive model (PLS-DA) was estimated using cross-validation and described by correct classification rate (CCR). Analyses were based on binary grouping of best overall response (RECIST v1.1; CR/PR/SD vs PD) and early/late progression using PFS data (cut-off 140 days). Results: Predictive signatures were discovered for anti-CTLA4 in cohort 1 (anti-CTLA4; n = 10; CCR = 100\%; 95\%CI 69-100\%) and confirmed in cohort 2 (anti-CTLA4; n = 28; CCR = 82\%; 95\%CI 63-94\%), as well as for anti-PD1 in cohort 3 (anti-PD1; n = 17; CCR = 76\%; 95\%CI 50-93\%), which was confirmed in cohort 4 (anti-PD1; n = 29; CCR = 72\%; 95\%CI 53-87\%), cohort 5 (anti-PD1; n = 38; CCR = 75\%; 95\%CI 57-87\%), and cohort 6 (anti-PD1; n = 16; non-evaluable due to the low number of responders). Conclusions: In advanced melanoma patients, kinase activity profiles of baseline PBMCs samples can predict the likelihood of response to anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 therapy. This assay may serve as a rapid and fast predictive liquid biomarker to stratify patients prior to treatment. Involvement of receptor tyrosine kinases underlying the mechanism are being further elucidated and a larger validation study is underway.},

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) could be an interesting surrogate tissue for identifying pharmacodynamic biomarkers. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the global serine/threonine kinase (STK) activity in PBMC from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using a high throughput kinomic profiling method. PamChip® microarrays were used to explore the STK kinomic profile in PBMC from 28 NSCLC patients before nivolumab initiation (D0) and on day 14 (D14) of the first administration. Two clusters of patients (A and B) were identified at D0, median overall survival (OS) tended to be longer in cluster A than in B (402 vs. 112.5 days, respectively; p = 0.15). Interestingly, the PD-L1 tumor cell score (p = 0.045), the count of CD8+ cells (p = 0.023) and the total body weight (p = 0.038) were statistically different between the clusters. On D14, clusters C and D were identified. Greater activity of most STK, especially those of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, was noticed among cluster C. No significant difference between C and D was observed regarding OS. Considering the small number of patients, results from this preliminary study are not conclusive. However, the 4-fold longer median OS in cluster A paves the way to further investigate, in a larger cohort of NSCLC patients, the benefit of basal STK kinomic profile in PBMC to identify responders to nivolumab therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sunitinib is a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor that has immune-modulating properties. In this context, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), mainly constituted by lymphocytes, could be a perfect surrogate tissue for identifying and assaying pharmacodynamic biomarkers of sunitinib. In this study, we investigated the changes in lymphocytes count as pharmacodynamic biomarker in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients under sunitinib therapy. Thereafter, we studied the ex vivo effect of sunitinib and SU12262 (active metabolite) on PBMC from naïve mRCC patients using a high throughput kinomic profiling method.
METHODS: The prognostic value of total lymphocytes count between Day 0 and Day 21 (expressed as a ratio D21/D0) was retrospectively investigated in 88 mRCC patients under sunitinib therapy. PTK PamChip® microarrays were used to explore prospectivelythe ex vivo effect of sunitinib and SU12662 on PTK activity in PBMC from 21 naïve mRCC patients.
RESULTS: In this retrospective study, D21/D0 lymphocytes ratio (Hazard Ratio, 1.83; CI95\%, 1.24-2.71; p=0.0023) was independently associated with PFS. Interestingly, kinomic analysis showed that D21/D0 lymphocytes ratio and Heng prognostic model was statistically associated with the ex vivo sunitinib and SU12662 effect in PBMC.
CONCLUSION: The present study highlights that D21/D0 total lymphocytes ratio could be a promising pharmacodynamic biomarker in mRCC patients treated with sunitinib. Additionally, it paves the way to investigate the kinomic profile in PBMC as a prognostic factor in a larger cohort of mRCC patients under sunitinib therapy.},

Therefore, the present study used a highly sensitive peptide-based kinase activity profiling approach to investigate if the basal activity of tyrosine (Tyr) and serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases of human lymphocytes is affected by the aerobic endurance training status. Results revealed that the activity of various tyrosine kinases of the FGFR family and ZAP70 was increased, whereas the activity of multiple Ser/Thr kinases such as IKKα, CaMK4, PKAα, PKCα+δ (among others) was decreased in lymphocytes of endurance trained athletes (ET). Moreover, functional associations between several differentially regulated kinases in ET-derived lymphocytes were demonstrated by phylogenetic mapping and network analysis. Especially, Ser/Thr kinases of the AGC-kinase (protein kinase A, G, and C) family represent exercise-sensitive key components within the lymphocytes kinase network that may mediate the long-term effects of endurance training. Furthermore, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and Reactome pathway analysis indicate that Ras as well as intracellular signaling by second messengers were found to be enriched in the ET individuals. Overall, our data suggest that endurance exercise training improves the adaptive immune competence by modulating the activity of multiple protein kinases in human lymphocytes.},

	issn = {2156-6976},
	abstract = {Erlotinib is commonly used as a second line treatment in non-small cell lung cancer patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations. In EGFR-wild type patients, however the results are limited. Therefore we evaluated whether the combination of the Protein kinase C-β inhibitor enzastaurin with erlotinib could enhance the effect in the A549 and H1650 cell lines. Cytotoxicity of erlotinib, enzastaurin and their 72-h simultaneous combination was assessed with the MTT assay. The pharmacologic interaction was studied using the method of Chou and Talalay, cell cycle perturbations were assessed by flow cytometry and modulation of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation was determined with ELISA. For protein phosphorylation of GSK3β we performed Western Blot analysis and a Pamgene phosphorylation array, while RT-PCR was used to investigate VEGF and VEGFR-2 expression before and after drug treatments. A synergistic interaction was found in both cell lines with mean CI of 0.58 and 0.63 in A549 and H1650 cells, respectively. Enzastaurin alone and in combination with erlotinib increased the percentage of cells in S and G2M phase, mostly in H1650 cells, while AKT, ERK1/2 and GSK3β phosphorylation were reduced in both cell lines. VEGF expression decreased 5.0 and 6.9 fold in A549 cells after enzastaurin alone and with erlotinib, respectively, while in H1650 only enzastaurin caused a relevant reduction in VEGF expression. The array showed differential phosphorylation of EGFR, GSK3β, EphA1 and MK14. In conclusion, enzastaurin is a protein kinase Cβ inhibitor, working on several cellular signaling pathways that are involved in proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. These features make it a good compound for combination therapy. In the present study the combination of enzastaurin and erlotinib gives synergistic results, warranting further investigation.},

This increased CDK activity is confirmed at the level of mRNA and protein expression in human and experimental PAH, respectively. Specific CDK inhibition by dinaciclib and palbociclib decreases PASMC proliferation via cell cycle arrest and interference with the downstream CDK-Rb (retinoblastoma protein)-E2F signaling pathway. In two experimental models of PAH (i.e., monocrotaline and Su5416/hypoxia treated rats) palbociclib reverses the elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, reduces right heart hypertrophy, restores the cardiac index, and reduces pulmonary vascular remodeling. These results demonstrate that inhibition of CDKs by palbociclib may be a therapeutic strategy in PAH.},

Expression of the ARv7-repressed targets and ARv7 protein expression are negatively correlated and predicts for outcome in PCa patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The irinotecan-induced phosphokinome changes in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells were used to guide the selection of targeted agents to be tested in combination with irinotecan.
METHODS: Phosphokinome profiling with peptide arrays of tumour samples from nude mice xenografted with HT29 cells and treated or not with an effective dose of irinotecan was used to identify signalling pathways activated by irinotecan treatment. Then, drugs targeting these pathways were combined in vitro with irinotecan to test potential synergistic effect. The interactions between these drug combinations were assessed by a dose matrix approach. Confirmation of the most potential combination has been confirmed in vivo in xenografted mice.
RESULTS: Irinotecan induced in vivo the activation of AKT and MEK1 phosphorylation. The dose matrix approach showed that BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor) and MEK162 (MEK inhibitor) are synergistic in vitro and in vivo with a cytostatic and cytotoxic effect, while combination of BKM120 and irinotecan or MEK162 and irinotecan are only additive or even antagonistic. However, the triple combination of SN38, BKM120 and MEK162 showed a better synergistic effect that BKM120 and MEK162, indicating that the cells need to inhibit both AKT and ERK pathways to become more sensitive to irinotecan-based chemotherapies.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of chemotherapy-induced phosphokinome changes helps to elucidate the mechanisms of drug resistance and to guide the selection of targets for combination therapies with synergistic activity.},

Myofibroblasts are the effector cells that excessively deposit extracellular matrix proteins thus compromising lung structure and function. Emerging literature suggests a correlation between fibrosis and metabolic alterations in IPF. In this study, we show that the first-line antidiabetic drug metformin exerts potent antifibrotic effects in the lung by modulating metabolic pathways, inhibiting TGFβ1 action, suppressing collagen formation, activating PPARγ signaling and inducing lipogenic differentiation in lung fibroblasts derived from IPF patients. Using genetic lineage tracing in a murine model of lung fibrosis, we show that metformin alters the fate of myofibroblasts and accelerates fibrosis resolution by inducing myofibroblast-to-lipofibroblast transdifferentiation. Detailed pathway analysis revealed a two-arm mechanism by which metformin accelerates fibrosis resolution. Our data report an antifibrotic role for metformin in the lung, thus warranting further therapeutic evaluation.},

	abstract = {Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive cation channel with widespread physiological importance; however, its role in the heart is poorly understood. Cardiac fibroblasts help preserve myocardial integrity and play a key role in regulating its repair and remodeling following stress or injury. Here we investigated Piezo1 expression and function in cultured human and mouse cardiac fibroblasts. RT-PCR experiments confirmed that Piezo1 mRNA in cardiac fibroblasts is expressed at levels similar to those in endothelial cells. The results of a Fura-2 intracellular Ca2+ assay validated Piezo1 as a functional ion channel that is activated by its agonist, Yoda1. Yoda1-induced Ca2+ entry was inhibited by Piezo1 blockers (gadolinium and ruthenium red) and was reduced proportionally by siRNA-mediated Piezo1 knockdown or in murine Piezo1+/- cells. Results from cell-attached patch clamp recordings on human cardiac fibroblasts established that they contain mechanically activated ion channels and that their pressure responses are reduced by Piezo1 knockdown. Investigation of Yoda1 effects on selected remodeling genes indicated that Piezo1 activation increases both mRNA levels and protein secretion of IL-6, a pro-hypertrophic and profibrotic cytokine, in a Piezo1-dependent manner. Moreover, Piezo1 knockdown reduced basal IL-6 expression from cells cultured on softer collagen-coated substrates. Multiplex kinase activity profiling combined with kinase inhibitor experiments and phosphospecific immunoblotting established that Piezo1 activation stimulates IL-6 secretion via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase downstream of Ca2+ entry. In summary, cardiac fibroblasts express mechanically activated Piezo1 channels coupled to secretion of the paracrine signaling molecule IL-6. Piezo1 may therefore be important in regulating cardiac remodeling.},

	abstract = {About 5\% of Triple negative breast cancer patients (TNBCs) who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) experience progressive disease (PD). Few reports are published on TNBCs with PD during NAC, whereas TNBCs that respond to NAC have been well-studied. We investigated kinase activity profiles of TNBCs to explore the biological differences underlying the lack of response to NAC. Among 740 TNBCs, 20 non-responders were identified. Seven non-responders and 10 TNBCs that did not receive NAC (control group) were evaluated. No correlation was observed between NAC response and age, menopausal status, tumor size and axillary lymph node status. Tyrosine kinase activity profiles of TNBC primary tissues from NAC non-responders and the controls were determined with a peptide microarray system. Kinase activity measurements showed that 35 peptides had significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) lower phosphorylation in non-responders. ZAP70, LCK, SYK and JAK2 were identified as differentially active upstream kinases. Pathway analysis suggested lower activity in immune-related pathways in non-responders. The number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was significantly lower (p = 0.0053) in non-responders. Kinases related to the immune system are less activated in non-responders. TILs evaluation suggested that the immune system is hardly active in non-responders and is not activated by NAC treatment.},

	abstract = {Protein phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in most of the cellular regulatory pathways. Experimental identification of protein kinases' (PKs) substrates with their phosphorylation sites is labor-intensive and often limited by the availability and optimization of enzymatic reactions. Recently, large-scale analysis of the phosphoproteome by the mass spectrometry (MS) has become a popular approach. But experimentally, it is still difficult to distinguish the kinase-specific sites on the substrates. In this regard, the in silico prediction of phosphorylation sites with their specific kinases using protein's primary sequences may provide guidelines for further experimental consideration and interpretation of MS phosphoproteomic data. A variety of such tools exists over the Internet and provides the predictions for at most 30 PK subfamilies. We downloaded the verified phosphorylation sites from the public databases and curated the literature extensively for recently found phosphorylation sites. With the hypothesis that PKs in the same subfamily share similar consensus sequences/motifs/functional patterns on substrates, we clustered the 216 unique PKs in 71 PK groups, according to the BLAST results and protein annotations. Then, we applied the group-based phosphorylation scoring (GPS) method on the data set; here, we present a comprehensive PK-specific prediction server GPS, which could predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from protein primary sequences for 71 different PK groups. GPS has been implemented in PHP and is available on a www server at http://973-proteinweb.ustc.edu.cn/gps/gps\_web/ .},

Besides serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases, GPS 5.0 also supports the prediction of dual-specificity kinase-specific p-sites. In the classical module of GPS 5.0, 617 individual predictors were constructed for predicting p-sites of 479 human PKs. To extend the application of GPS 5.0, a species-specific module was implemented to predict kinase-specific p-sites for 44,795 PKs in 161 eukaryotes.

	abstract = {Phosphorylation of specific substrates by protein kinases is a key control mechanism for vital cell-fate decisions and other cellular processes. However, discovering specific kinase-substrate relationships is time-consuming and often rather serendipitous. Computational predictions alleviate these challenges, but the current approaches suffer from limitations like restricted kinome coverage and inaccuracy. They also typically utilise only local features without reflecting broader interaction context. To address these limitations, we have developed an alternative predictive model. It uses statistical relational learning on top of phosphorylation networks interpreted as knowledge graphs, a simple yet robust model for representing networked knowledge. Compared to a representative selection of six existing systems, our model has the highest kinome coverage and produces biologically valid high-confidence predictions not possible with the other tools. Specifically, we have experimentally validated predictions of previously unknown phosphorylations by the LATS1, AKT1, PKA and MST2 kinases in human. Thus, our tool is useful for focusing phosphoproteomic experiments, and facilitates the discovery of new phosphorylation reactions. Our model can be accessed publicly via an easy-to-use web interface (LinkPhinder)., LinkPhinder is a new approach to prediction of protein signalling networks based on kinase-substrate relationships that outperforms existing approaches. Phosphorylation networks govern virtually all fundamental biochemical processes in cells, and thus have moved into the centre of interest in biology, medicine and drug development. Fundamentally different from current approaches, LinkPhinder is inherently network-based and makes use of the most recent AI developments. We represent existing phosphorylation data as knowledge graphs, a format for large-scale and robust knowledge representation. Training a link prediction model on such a structure leads to novel, biologically valid phosphorylation network predictions that cannot be made with competing tools. Thus our new conceptual approach can lead to establishing a new niche of AI applications in computational biology.},

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylates tau in both in vitro and in vivo models.

	abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous molecule that plays a multifactorial role in several cellular processes. In the central nervous system, the NO dual nature in neuroprotection and neurotoxicity has been explored to unveil its involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A growing body of research shows that the activation of the NO signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic adenine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB) (so-called NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway) ameliorates altered neuroplasticity and memory deficits in AD animal models. In addition to NO donors, several other pharmacological agents, such as phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have been used to activate the pathway and rescue memory disorders. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, are marketed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and arterial pulmonary hypertension due to their vasodilatory properties. The ability of PDE5 inhibitors to interfere with the NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway by increasing the levels of cGMP has prompted the hypothesis that PDE5 inhibition might be used as an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. To this end, newly designed PDE5 inhibitors belonging to different chemical classes with improved pharmacologic profile (e.g. higher potency, improved selectivity, and blood-brain barrier penetration) have been synthesized and evaluated in several animal models of AD. In addition, recent medicinal chemistry effort has led to the development of agents concurrently acting on the PDE5 enzyme and a second target involved in AD. Both marketed and investigational PDE5 inhibitors have shown to reverse cognitive defects in young and aged wild type mice as well as transgenic mouse models of AD and tauopathy using a variety of behavioral tasks. These studies confirmed the therapeutic potential of PDE5 inhibitors as cognitive enhancers. However, clinical studies assessing cognitive functions using marketed PDE5 inhibitors have not been conclusive. Drug discovery efforts by our group and others are currently directed towards the development of novel PDE5 inhibitors tailored to AD with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. In summary, the present perspective reports an overview of the correlation between the NO signaling and AD, as well as an outline of the PDE5 inhibitors used as an alternative approach in altering the NO pathway leading to an improvement of learning and memory. The last two sections describe the preclinical and clinical evaluation of PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of AD, providing a comprehensive analysis of the current status of the AD drug discovery efforts involving PDE5 as a new therapeutic target.},

Forskolin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day, oral) treatment was administered to i.c.v. STZ-treated and aged mice for 14 days. The Morris Water Maze test was used to evaluate learning and memory. Estimation of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, brain glutathione, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species, brain myeloperoxidase levels, and histopathological studies were also performed. Both STZ i.c.v. and aging resulted in a marked decline in Morris Water Maze performance, reflecting impairment of learning and memory. STZ i.c.v.-treated mice and aged mice showed a marked accentuation of AChE activity, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species and myeloperoxidase levels along with a decrease in the glutathione level. Further, the stained micrographs of STZ-treated mice and aged mice indicated pathological changes, severe neutrophilic infiltration, and amyloid deposition. Forskolin treatment significantly attenuated STZ-induced and age-related memory deficits, and biochemical and histopathological alterations. The findings indicate that the PKA activator forskolin probably alleviated memory deficits by virtue of its anticholinesterase, antiamyloid, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory effects.

	abstract = {Deficits in brain function that are associated with aging and age-related diseases benefit very little from currently available therapies, suggesting a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is needed to develop improved drugs. Here, we review the literature to test the hypothesis that a break down in cyclic nucleotide signaling at the level of synthesis, execution, and/or degradation may contribute to these deficits. A number of findings have been reported in both the human and animal model literature that point to brain region-specific changes in Galphas (a.k.a. Gαs or Gsα), adenylyl cyclase, 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, protein kinase A (PKA), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac), hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (HCNs), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclase, 3′,5′-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), protein kinase G (PKG) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Among the most reproducible findings are 1) elevated circulating ANP and BNP levels being associated with cognitive dysfunction or dementia independent of cardiovascular effects, 2) reduced basal and/or NMDA-stimulated cGMP levels in brain with aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3) reduced adenylyl cyclase activity in hippocampus and specific cortical regions with aging or AD, 4) reduced expression/activity of PKA in temporal cortex and hippocampus with AD, 5) reduced phosphorylation of CREB in hippocampus with aging or AD, 6) reduced expression/activity of the PDE4 family in brain with aging, 7) reduced expression of PDE10A in the striatum with Huntington's disease (HD) or Parkinson's disease, and 8) beneficial effects of select PDE inhibitors, particularly PDE10 inhibitors in HD models and PDE4 and PDE5 inhibitors in aging and AD models. Although these findings generally point to a reduction in cyclic nucleotide signaling being associated with aging and age-related diseases, there are exceptions. In particular, there is evidence for increased cAMP signaling specifically in aged prefrontal cortex, AD cerebral vessels, and PD hippocampus. Thus, if cyclic nucleotide signaling is going to be targeted effectively for therapeutic gain, it will have to be manipulated in a brain region-specific manner.},

	abstract = {J. Neurochem. (2011) 118, 460–474. Abstract AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulates energy production via glucose and lipid metabolism, whereas it inhibits energy consuming functions, such as protein and cholesterol synthesis. Increased cytoplasmic AMP and Ca2+ levels are the major activators of neuronal AMPK signaling. Interestingly, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with several abnormalities in neuronal energy metabolism, for example, decline in glucose uptake, mitochondrial dysfunctions and defects in cholesterol metabolism, and in addition, with problems in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis. Epidemiological studies have also revealed that many metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are risk factors for cognitive impairment and sporadic AD. Emerging studies indicate that AMPK signaling can regulate tau protein phosphorylation and amyloidogenesis, the major hallmarks of AD. AMPK is also a potent activator of autophagic degradation which seems to be suppressed in AD. All these observations imply that AMPK is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the responses of AMPK activation are dependent on stimulation and the extent of activating stress. Evidently, AMPK signaling can repress and delay the appearance of AD pathology but later on, with increasing neuronal stress, it can trigger detrimental effects that augment AD pathogenesis. We will outline the potential role of AMPK function in respect to various aspects affecting AD pathogenesis.},

By contrast, a decline in PKA signaling contributes to the etiology of several brain degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, suggesting that PKA predominantly plays a neuroprotective role. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are large multidomain scaffold proteins that target PKA and other signaling molecules to distinct subcellular sites to strategically localize PKA signaling at dendrites, dendritic spines, cytosol, and axons. PKA can be recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane by associating with three different AKAPs to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, structure, mitochondrial respiration, trafficking, dendrite morphology, and neuronal survival. In this review, we survey the myriad of essential neuronal functions modulated by PKA but place a special emphasis on mitochondrially localized PKA. Finally, we offer an updated overview of how loss of PKA signaling contributes to the etiology of several brain degenerative diseases.},

METHODS: Cognitive deficits were induced in mice by injecting Streptozotocin (STZ) intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.); on the other hand aged animals were procured as a natural model of dementia. To assess cognitive function of mice Morris water maze (MWM) test was utilized; various biochemical studies and histopathological studies were also carried out.
RESULTS: STZ injection and aging resulted in significant development of cognitive deficits; along-with enhancement of Myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Species (TBARS), Acetylcholinestrase (AChE) activity, and reduced Glutathione (GSH) levels. Histopathological studies demonstrated pathological changes such as amyloid deposition and severe neutrophilic infiltration in brains of these mice. Donepezil /combination of Tacrolimus and Forskolin treatment markedly improve cognitive function, biochemical parameters, and histopathological alterations in STZ treated and aged mice.
CONCLUSION: The outcome reveals that combination of CaN inhibitor and PKA activator has significantly alleviated memory dysfunction, biochemical alteration and histopathological changes quiet comparable to Donepezil. It has been inferred that combination of CaN and PKA can be served as an important target in dementia.},

	abstract = {Cells communicate with other cells, and process cues from their environment, via signaling pathways, in which extracellular cues trigger a cascade of information flow, causing signaling molecules to become chemically, physically or locationally modified, gain new functional capabilities, and affect subsequent molecules in the cascade, culminating in a phenotypic cellular response. Mapping the influence connections among biomolecules in a signaling cascade aids in understanding of the underlying biological process and in development of therapeutics for diseases involving aberrant pathways, such as cancer and autoimmune disease. In this thesis, we present an approach for automatically reverse-engineering the structure of a signaling pathway, from high-throughput data. We apply Bayesian network structure inference to signaling protein measurements performed in thousands of single cells, using a machine called a flow cytorneter. Our de novo reconstruction of a T-cell signaling map was highly accurate, closely reproducing the known pathway structure, and accurately predicted novel pathway connections. The flow cytometry measurements include specific perturbations of signaling molecules, aiding in a causal interpretation of the Bayesian network graph structure.
(cont.) However, this machine can measure only -4-12 molecules per cell, too few for effective coverage of a signaling pathway. To address this problem, we employ a number of biologically motivated assumptions to extend our technique to scale up from the number of molecules measured to larger models, using measurements of overlapping variable subsets. We demonstrate this approach by scaling up to a model of 11 variables, using 15 overlapping 4-variable measurements.},

	abstract = {Developmental cognitive deficits including X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) can be caused by mutations in P21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3) that disrupt actin dynamics in dendritic spines. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), where both PAK1 and PAK3 are dysregulated, may share final common pathways with XLMR. Independent of familial mutation, cognitive deficits emerging with aging, notably AD, begin after decades of normal function. This prolonged prodromal period involves the buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ) extracellular plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Subsequently region dependent deficits in synapses, dendritic spines and cognition coincide with dysregulation in PAK1 and PAK. Specifically proximal to decline, cytoplasmic levels of actin-regulating Rho GTPase and PAK1 kinase are decreased in moderate to severe AD, while aberrant activation and translocation of PAK1 appears around the onset of cognitive deficits. Downstream to PAK1, LIM kinase inactivates cofilin, contributing to cofilin pathology, while the activation of Rho-dependent kinase ROCK increases Aβ production. Aβ activation of fyn disrupts neuronal PAK1 and ROCK-mediated signaling, resulting in synaptic deficits. Reductions in PAK1 by the anti-amyloid compound curcumin suppress synaptotoxicity. Similarly other neurological disorders, including Huntington disease (HD) show dysregulation of PAKs. PAK1 modulates mutant huntingtin toxicity by enhancing huntingtin aggregation, and inhibition of PAK activity protects HD as well as fragile X syndrome (FXS) symptoms. Since PAK plays critical roles in learning and memory and is disrupted in many cognitive disorders, targeting PAK signaling in AD, HD and XLMR may be a novel common therapeutic target for AD, HD and XLMR.},

However, it is unknown whether there is an association between the polymorphisms of ROCK1 and AD. We sought to identify the potential association between ROCK1 gene polymorphisms and AD in the Chinese Han population.
Methods: A total of 295 patients with AD and 206 healthy controls from multiple centers were enrolled in this study. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs35996865, rs11873284, and rs2127958) in ROCK1 gene were analyzed using Sanger sequencing.
Results: We did not find any significant differences between AD and control groups with regards to the frequency of these three ROCK1 polymorphisms. Further, the three SNP genotype frequencies and allele frequencies did not show significant differences between patients of AD and controls in APOE4-stratified subjects (P{\textgreater}0.01). Additionally, the three SNPs did not show significant differences even when adopting a four-inheritance model by logistic regression.
Conclusions: This is the first multicenter pilot study to evaluate the contribution of ROCK1 genetic variance to AD risk. Our data demonstrated that the ROCK1 gene may not influence the risk of AD by interacting with APOE among Chinese Han people.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Many studies have already suggested the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the functions of lncRNA Taurine Upregulated Gene 1 (TUG1) in AD have been scarcely discussed. This study aims to verify how TUG1 affects hippocampal neurons in AD through modulation of microRNA-15a (miR-15a)/Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1).
METHOD: AD mice was modeled through injection of β-amyloid 25-35 (Aβ25-35) into the lateral ventricle. After modeling, the mice were injected with altered TUG1 and/or miR-15a agomir lentiviruses. The spatial learning ability and memory ability of mice were detected through Morris water maze test. Hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress indicators in AD mice were then detected. The hippocampal neuron AD model was induced by Aβ25-35. Next, the neurons were, respectively, transfected with altered TUG1 vector and/or miR-15a mimics to determine the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. The interactions between TUG1 and miR-15a, and between miR-15a and ROCK1 were assessed using bioinformatic prediction, dual luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA-pull-down assay.
RESULTS: In the animal models, Aβ25-35-induced mice exhibited decreased spatial learning and memory ability, obvious pathological injury, promoted hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and decreased antioxidant ability. TUG1 silencing and miR-15a elevation improved spatial learning ability and memory ability, ameliorated pathological injury, depressed neuronal apoptosis, and strengthened antioxidant ability of hippocampal neurons in AD mice. In cellular models, Aβ25-35-treated hippocampal neurons presented inhibited neuronal viability and promoted neuronal apoptosis. TUG1 silencing and miR-15a elevation increased viability and limited apoptosis of Aβ25-35-treated hippocampal neurons. TUG1 specifically bound to miR-15a, and miR-15a targeted ROCK1.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, this study reveals that TUG1 knockdown restricts apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in AD by elevating miR-15a and suppressing ROCK1 expression, and provides a new therapeutic target for AD treatment.},

We show that ROCK1 is colocalized with mature amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in patients with AD, in that ROCK1 enhances the amyloidogenic pathway, and that ROCK1 mediated autophagy enhances the intracellular buildup of Aβ in a cell model of AD (confirmed by increased ROCK1 and decreased Beclin 1 protein levels, with neuronal autophagosome accumulation in prefrontal cortex of AD APP/PS1 mouse model). In vitro over-expression of ROCK1 leads to a decrease in Aβ secretion and an increase in the expression of autophagy-related molecules. ROCK1 interacts with Beclin1, an autophagy initiator, and enhances the intracellular accumulation of Aβ. Reciprocally, overexpression of APP/Aβ promotes ROCK1 expression. Our data suggest ROCK1 participates in regulating Aβ secretion, APP shedding and autophagosome accumulation, and that ROCK1, rather than other kinases, is more likely to be a targetable enzyme for AD therapy.},

Here, we show that the rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) is a target of microRNA-146a in neural cells. Knockdown of ROCK1 mimicked the effects of microRNA-146a overexpression and induced abnormal tau phosphorylation, which was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The ROCK1/PTEN pathway has been implicated in the neuronal hyperphosphorylation of tau that occurs in AD. To determine the function of ROCK1 in AD, brain tissue from 17 donors with low, intermediate or high probability of AD pathology were obtained and analyzed. Data showed that ROCK1 protein levels were reduced and ROCK1 colocalised with hyperphosphorylated tau in early neurofibrillary tangles. Intra-hippocampal delivery of a microRNA-146a specific inhibitor (antagomir) into 5xFAD mice showed enhanced hippocampal levels of ROCK1 protein and repressed tau hyperphosphorylation, partly restoring memory function in the 5xFAD mice. Our in vitro and in vivo results confirm that dysregulation of microRNA-146a biogenesis contributes to tau hyperphosphorylation and AD pathogenesis, and inhibition of this microRNA could be a viable novel in vivo therapy for AD.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and mitigating amyloid-β (Aβ) levels may serve as a rational therapeutic avenue to slow AD progression. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) is proposed to curb Aβ levels, and mechanisms that underlie ROCK2's effects on Aβ production are defined. How ROCK1 affects Aβ generation remains a critical barrier. Here, we report that ROCK1 protein levels were elevated in mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI) and AD brains compared to controls. Aβ42 oligomers marginally increased ROCK1 and ROCK2 protein levels in neurons but strongly induced phosphorylation of Lim kinase 1 (LIMK1), suggesting that Aβ42 activates ROCKs. RNAi depletion of ROCK1 or ROCK2 suppressed endogenous Aβ40 production in neurons, and Aβ40 levels were reduced in brains of ROCK1 heterozygous knock-out mice compared to wild-type littermate controls. ROCK1 knockdown decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP), and treatment with bafilomycin accumulated APP levels in neurons depleted of ROCK1. These observations suggest that reduction of ROCK1 diminishes Aβ levels by enhancing APP protein degradation. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are therapeutic targets to combat Aβ production in AD. Mitigating amyloid-β (Aβ) levels is a rational strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, however, therapeutic targets with clinically available drugs are lacking. We hypothesize that Aβ accumulation in mild cognitive impairment because of AD (MCI) and AD activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway which in turn fuels production of Aβ. Escalation of this cycle over the course of many years may contribute to the buildup of amyloid pathology in MCI and/or AD.},

Ganoderma lucidum triterpenoids (GLTs) have nutritional health benefits and has been shown to promote health and longevity, but a protective effect of GLTs on AD damage has not yet been reported. The objective of this research was to elucidate the phylactic effect of GLTs on AD model mice and cells and to explore its underlying mechanisms. Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted to detect changes in the cognitive function of mice. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was applied to observe pathological changes in the hippocampus. Silver nitrate staining was applied to observe the hippocampal neuronal tangles (NFTs). Apoptosis of the hippocampal neurons in mouse brain tissue was determined by TUNEL staining. The expression levels of apoptosis-related protein Bcl2, Bax, and caspase 3/cleaved caspase 3; antioxidative protein Nrf2, NQO1, and HO1; and ROCK signaling pathway-associated proteins ROCK2 and ROCK1 were measured by western blot. In vivo experiments show that 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice appeared to have impaired acquisition of spatial learning and GLTs could reduce cognitive impairment in AD mice. Compared to normal mice, the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mouse's brains was severely damaged, while GLTs could alleviate this symptom by inhibiting apoptosis, relieving oxidative damage, and inactivating the ROCK signaling pathway. In in vitro cell experiments, Aβ25-35 was applied to induce hippocampal neurons into AD model cells. GLTs promoted cell proliferation, facilitated superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression, and inhibited malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) expression of neurons. Our study highlights that GLTs improve cognitive impairment, alleviate neuronal damage, and inhibit apoptosis in the hippocampus tissues and cells in AD through inhibiting the ROCK signaling pathway.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder where the cognitive deficit is the hallmark symptom reflecting the progression of the disease. Synaptic dysfunction is a sensitive parameter of the AD pathology. Rho GTPases and the Rho kinases, ROCK1/2, and PAK1-3, are important regulators of synaptic plasticity, especially in maintaining the actin cytoskeleton of dendritic spines. Recent studies have revealed that beta-amyloid oligomers can inhibit PAK and stimulate ROCK-mediated signaling. Both of these effects enhance the disassembly of synaptic actin filaments and ultimately evoke synaptic loss. Brain tissue in AD recognizes the beta-amyloid peptide oligomers as foreign protein particles and mounts an inflammatory defense via Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling which causes synaptic impairment. We will review here the dysfunction of ROCK, PAK, and Toll signaling associated with AD pathology. The protection of synapses in AD may provide new therapeutic approaches to combatting the cognitive impairment in AD.},

Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

Owing to an increasing number of in vivo phosphorylation sites that have been identified by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the RegPhos, available online at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/RegPhos2/, was developed to explore protein phosphorylation networks in human. In this update, we not only enhance the data content in human but also investigate kinase–substrate phosphorylation networks in mouse and rat. The experimentally validated phosphorylation sites as well as their catalytic kinases were extracted from public resources, and MS/MS phosphopeptides were manually curated from research articles. RegPhos 2.0 aims to provide a more comprehensive view of intracellular signaling networks by integrating the information of metabolic pathways and protein–protein interactions. A case study shows that analyzing the phosphoproteome profile of time-dependent cell activation obtained from Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the RegPhos deciphered not only the consistent scheme in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway but also novel regulatory molecules that may involve in it. With an attempt to help users efficiently identify the candidate biomarkers in cancers, 30 microarray experiments, including 39 cancerous versus normal cells, were analyzed for detecting cancer-specific expressed genes coding for kinases and their substrates.

	abstract = {Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in intracellular signal transduction. With the increasing number of experimental phosphorylation sites that has been identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the desire to explore the networks of protein kinases and substrates is motivated. Manning et al. have identified 518 human kinase genes, which provide a starting point for comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylation networks. In this study, a knowledgebase is developed to integrate experimentally verified protein phosphorylation data and protein–protein interaction data for constructing the protein kinase–substrate phosphorylation networks in human. A total of 21 110 experimental verified phosphorylation sites within 5092 human proteins are collected. However, only 4138 phosphorylation sites (∼20\%) have the annotation of catalytic kinases from public domain. In order to fully investigate how protein kinases regulate the intracellular processes, a published kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction tool, named KinasePhos is incorporated for assigning the potential kinase. The web-based system, RegPhos, can let users input a group of human proteins; consequently, the phosphorylation network associated with the protein subcellular localization can be explored. Additionally, time-coursed microarray expression data is subsequently used to represent the degree of similarity in the expression profiles of network members. A case study demonstrates that the proposed scheme not only identify the correct network of insulin signaling but also detect a novel signaling pathway that may cross-talk with insulin signaling network.

This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses.
For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x)=arsinh(a+bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for
microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing
transformations.
For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation,
and Δh with the log-ratio.
The parameters of h together with those of the calibration between experiments
are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estimation.

A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because they provide a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate this method on the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al. (1998).},

Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are responsible for the reuptake of glutamate, preventing non-physiological spillover from the synapse. Postmortem studies have revealed significant dysregulation of EAAT expression in various brain regions at the cellular and subcellular level. Recent animal studies have also demonstrated a role for glutamate spillover as a mechanism of disease. In this review, we describe current evidence for the role of glutamate transporters in regulating synaptic plasticity and transmission. In neuropsychiatric conditions, EAAT splice variant expression is altered. There are changes in the localization of the transporters and disruption of the metabolic and structural protein network that supports EAAT activity. This results in aberrant neuroplasticity and excitatory signaling, contributing to the symptoms associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Understanding the complex functions of glutamate transporters will clarify the relevance of their role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Recent advances have linked the pathophysiology of schizophrenia with abnormalities of the glutamate neurotransmitter system. Elements of glutamatergic neurotransmission implicated in schizophrenia, including glutamate receptors and receptor-associated molecules, have critical roles in long-term potentiation, a molecular correlate of neuroplasticity. We suggest that schizophrenia can be considered a disorder of plasticity, associated with molecular abnormalities of the glutamate synapse. Copyright 2004, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A prespecified set of genes may be enriched, to varying degrees, for genes that have altered expression levels relative to two or more states of a cell. Knowing the enrichment of gene sets defined by functional categories, such as gene ontology (GO) annotations, is valuable for analyzing the biological signals in microarray expression data. A common approach to measuring enrichment is by cross-classifying genes according to membership in a functional category and membership on a selected list of significantly altered genes. A small Fisher's exact test \$p\$-value, for example, in this \$2{\textbackslash}times2\$ table is indicative of enrichment. Other category analysis methods retain the quantitative gene-level scores and measure significance by referring a category-level statistic to a permutation distribution associated with the original differential expression problem. We describe a class of random-set scoring methods that measure distinct components of the enrichment signal. The class includes Fisher's test based on selected genes and also tests that average gene-level evidence across the category. Averaging and selection methods are compared empirically using Affymetrix data on expression in nasopharyngeal cancer tissue, and theoretically using a location model of differential expression. We find that each method has a domain of superiority in the state space of enrichment problems, and that both methods have benefits in practice. Our analysis also addresses two problems related to multiple-category inference, namely, that equally enriched categories are not detected with equal probability if they are of different sizes, and also that there is dependence among category statistics owing to shared genes. Random-set enrichment calculations do not require Monte Carlo for implementation. They are made available in the R package allez.},

	abstract = {Motivation: To fully understand how a protein kinase regulates biological processes, it is imperative to first identify its substrate(s) and interacting protein(s). However, of the 518 known human serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases, 35\% of these have known substrates, while 14\% of the kinases have identified substrate recognition motifs. In contrast, 85\% of the kinases have protein-protein interaction (PPI) datasets, raising the possibility that we might reveal potential kinase-substrate pairs from these PPIs. Results: PhosphoPOINT, a comprehensive human kinase interactome and phospho-protein database, is a collection of 4195 phospho-proteins with a total of 15 738 phosphorylation sites. PhosphoPOINT annotates the interactions among kinases, with their down-stream substrates and with interacting (phospho)-proteins to modulate the kinase-substrate pairs. PhosphoPOINT implements various gene expression profiles and Gene Ontology cellular component information to evaluate each kinase and their interacting (phospho)-proteins/substrates. Integration of cSNPs that cause amino acids change with the proteins with the phosphoprotein dataset reveals that 64 phosphorylation sites result in a disease phenotypes when changed; the linked phenotypes include schizophrenia and hypertension. PhosphoPOINT also provides a search function for all phospho-peptides using about 300 known kinase/phosphatase substrate/ binding motifs. Altogether, PhosphoPOINT provides robust annotation for kinases, their downstream substrates and their interaction (phospho)-proteins and this should accelerate the functional characterization of kinomemediated signaling. © The Author 2008.

	abstract = {Motivation: The determinants of kinase-substrate phosphorylation can be found both in the substrate sequence and the surrounding cellular context. Cell cycle progression, interactions with mediating proteins and even prior phosphorylation events are necessary for kinases to maintain substrate specificity. While much work has focussed on the use of sequence-based methods to predict phosphorylation sites, there has been very little work invested into the application of systems biology to understand phosphorylation. Lack of specificity in many kinase substrate binding motifs means that sequence methods for predicting kinase binding sites are susceptible to high false-positive rates. Results: We present here a model that takes into account protein-protein interaction information, and protein abundance data across the cell cycle to predict kinase substrates for 59 human kinases that are representative of important biological pathways. The model shows high accuracy for substrate prediction (with an average AUC of 0.86) across the 59 kinases tested. When using the model to complement sequence-based kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction, we found that the additional information increased prediction performance for most comparisons made, particularly on kinases from the CMGC family. We then used our model to identify functional overlaps between predicted CDK2 substrates and targets from the E2F family of transcription factors. Our results demonstrate that a model harnessing context data can account for the short-falls in sequence information and provide a robust description of the cellular events that regulate protein phosphorylation.},

	abstract = {Latent variables allow probabilistic graphical models to capture nuance and structure in important domains such as network science, natural language processing, and computer vision. Naive approaches to learning such complex models can be prohibitively expensive-because they require repeated inferences to update beliefs about latent variables-so lifting this restriction for useful classes of models is an important problem. Hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs) are graphical models that allow highly scalable inference and learning in structured domains, in part by representing structured problems with continuous variables. However, this representation leads to challenges when learning with latent variables. We introduce paired-dual learning, a framework that greatly speeds up training by using tractable entropy surrogates and avoiding repeated inferences. Paired-dual learning optimizes an objective with a pair of dual inference problems. This allows fast, joint optimization of parameters and dual variables. We evaluate on social-group detection, trust prediction in social networks, and image reconstruction, finding that paired-dual learning trains models as accurate as those trained by traditional methods in much less time, often before traditional methods make even a single parameter update.},

	abstract = {Oxytocin, while classically known for its role in parturition, lactation, and social behavior, also has been implicated in the control of sodium homeostasis in animal models. To improve our understanding of oxytocin physiology in humans, we measured basal oxytocin levels under low- and liberal-dietary-sodium conditions and following a peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) infusion. Ten healthy individuals underwent a 6-day standardized low-sodium diet and a 6-day liberal-sodium diet. Each diet was followed by a graded ANG II infusion for 30-min sequential intervals at doses of 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 ng·kg −1 ·min −1 . Fasting serum oxytocin was assessed before and after ANG II infusion. Basal oxytocin levels (1,498.5 ± 94.7 vs. 1,663.3 ± 213.9 pg/ml, P = 0.51) did not differ after the low- and liberal-sodium diets. Following the ANG II infusion, ANG II levels and mean arterial pressure significantly increased as expected. In contrast, the ANG II infusion significantly lowered oxytocin levels from 1,498.5 ± 94.7 vs. 1,151.7 ± 118.1 pg/ml ( P {\textless} 0.001) on the low-sodium diet and from 1,663.3 ± 213.9 vs. 1,095.2 ± 87.4 pg/ml ( P = 0.03) on the liberal-sodium diet. The percent change in oxytocin following the ANG II infusion did not differ by sodium diet (−25 ± 5\% vs. −28 ± 7\% low- vs. liberal-sodium conditions, P {\textgreater} 0.99).

Laser-capture microdissection-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine these pathways at the cellular level. We found decreases in hexokinase (HXK) and phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity in the DLPFC, as well as decreased PFK1 mRNA expression. In pyramidal neurons, we found an increase in monocarboxylate transporter 1 mRNA expression, and decreases in HXK1, PFK1, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and GLUT3 mRNA expression.

In addition, the role of endogenous opioids in the control of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and/or oxytocin (OT) responses to ANG II was evaluated with the administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone. ANG II (i.v. infusion for 60 min of successively increasing doses of 4, 8 and 16 ng/kg min; each dose for 20 min) was given to 7 normal men, alone or together with naloxone (10 or 20 mg injected i.v. just before ANG II infusion). In all subjects, control experiments with naloxone (10 or 20 mg) alone were also performed. ANG II induced a significant increase in plasma concentrations of AVP and OT. The AVP and OT responses to ANG II had a similar magnitude and followed a similar pattern. The mean peak levels of both hormones were reached at 60 min after the beginning of ANG II infusion. The administration of 10 or 20 mg naloxone alone did not modify the circulating concentrations of AVP and OT. The pretreatment with naloxone significantly increased both ANG II-induced AVP and OT increases twofold, without changing the time course and the secretory pattern of the hormonal responses. These data demonstrate that systemic administration of ANG II in man induces similar simultaneous increments in plasma levels of both AVP and OT. Furthermore, these data suggest the involvement of a naloxone-sensitive opioid mechanism in the regulation of both AVP and OT responses to ANG II in man. © 1991 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

	abstract = {Converging evidence suggests bioenergetic defects contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may underlie cognitive dysfunction. The transport and metabolism of lactate energetically couples astrocytes and neurons and supports brain bioenergetics. We examined the concentration of lactate in postmortem brain (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) in subjects with schizophrenia, in two animal models of schizophrenia, the GluN1 knockdown mouse model and mutant disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) mouse model, as well as inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a schizophrenia subject with the DISC1 mutation. We found increased lactate in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p = 0.043, n = 16/group) in schizophrenia, as well as in frontal cortical neurons differentiated from a subject with schizophrenia with the DISC1 mutation (p = 0.032). We also found a decrease in lactate in mice with induced expression of mutant human DISC1 specifically in astrocytes (p = 0.049). These results build upon the body of evidence supporting bioenergetic dysfunction in schizophrenia, and suggests changes in lactate are a key feature of this often devastating severe mental illness.},

	abstract = {Complex brain disorders are highly heritable and arise from a complex polygenic risk architecture. Many disease-associated loci are found in non-coding regions that house regulatory elements. These elements influence the transcription of target genes—many of which demonstrate cell-type-specific expression patterns—and thereby affect phenotypically relevant molecular pathways. Thus, cell-type-specificity must be considered when prioritizing candidate risk loci, variants and target genes. This Review discusses the use of high-throughput assays in human induced pluripotent stem cell-based neurodevelopmental models to probe genetic risk in a cell-type- and patient-specific manner. The application of massively parallel reporter assays in human induced pluripotent stem cells can characterize the human regulome and test the transcriptional responses of putative regulatory elements. Parallel CRISPR-based screens can further functionally dissect this genetic regulatory architecture. The integration of these emerging technologies could decode genetic risk into medically actionable information, thereby improving genetic diagnosis and identifying novel points of therapeutic intervention.},

We performed in vitro kinetic assays on PBMCs in 195 MS patients and 60 matched controls and quantified the phosphorylation of 17 kinases using xMAP assays. Phosphoprotein levels were tested for association with genetic susceptibility by typing 112 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MS susceptibility. We found increased phosphorylation of MP2K1 in MS patients relative to the controls. Moreover, we identified one SNP located in the PHDGH gene and another on IRF8 gene that were associated with MP2K1 phosphorylation levels, providing a first clue on how this MS risk gene may act. The analyses in patients treated with disease-modifying drugs identified the phosphorylation of each receptor’s downstream kinases. Finally, using flow cytometry, we detected in MS patients increased STAT1, STAT3, TF65, and HSPB1 phosphorylation in CD19 + cells. These findings indicate the activation of cell survival and proliferation (MAPK), and proinflammatory (STAT) pathways in the immune cells of MS patients, primarily in B cells. The changes in the activation of these kinases suggest that these pathways may represent therapeutic targets for modulation by kinase inhibitors.},

In this article, we summarize the basic workflow to explain how to apply machine learning technology in the networking domain. Then we provide a selective survey of the latest representative advances with explanations of their design principles and benefits. These advances are divided into several network design objectives and the detailed information of how they perform in each step of MLN workflow is presented. Finally, we shed light on the new opportunities in networking design and community building of this new inter-discipline.

	abstract = {"The state of the art presented by the experts in the field." - Ross D. Shachter, Department of Engineering-Economic Systems and Operations Research, Stanford University Graphical models, a marriage between probability theory and graph theory, provide a natural tool for dealing with two problems that occur throughout applied mathematics and engineering-uncertainty and complexity. In particular, they play an increasingly important role in the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms. Fundamental to the idea of a graphical model is the notion of modularity: a complex system is built by combining simpler parts. Probability theory serves as the glue whereby the parts are combined, ensuring that the system as a whole is consistent and providing ways to interface models to data. Graph theory provides both an intuitively appealing interface by which humans can model highly interacting sets of variables and a data structure that lends itself naturally to the design of efficient general-purpose algorithms. This book presents an in-depth exploration of issues related to learning within the graphical model formalism. Four chapters are tutorial chapters-Robert Cowell on Inference for Bayesian Networks, David MacKay on Monte Carlo Methods, Michael I. Jordan et al. on Variational Methods, and David Heckerman on Learning with Bayesian Networks. The remaining chapters cover a wide range of topics of current research interest.},

	abstract = {The 2002-3 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was one of the most significant public health events in recent history. An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses, attempts to isolate the progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and Africa, but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9\% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1 also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy for pandemic preparedness. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

To characterize molecular systems associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), we constructed gene-regulatory networks in 1,647 postmortem brain tissues from LOAD patients and nondemented subjects, and we demonstrate that LOAD reconfigures specific portions of the molecular interaction structure. Through an integrative network-based approach, we rank-ordered these network structures for relevance to LOAD pathology, highlighting an immune- and microglia-specific module that is dominated by genes involved in pathogen phagocytosis, contains TYROBP as a key regulator, and is upregulated in LOAD. Mouse microglia cells overexpressing intact or truncated TYROBP revealed expression changes that significantly overlapped the human brain TYROBP network. Thus the causal network structure is a useful predictor of response to gene perturbations and presents a framework to test models of disease mechanisms underlying LOAD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Also included is a subset of the S100 family members that has been documented recently as regulatory elements of innate immunity. Samples from patients with long-term T1D had a reduced level of mRNA for most of selected innate and adaptive immune genes. No such reduction was detected in samples collected from at-risk or new-onset T1D patients. Analyses of regulatory gene expression ratios revealed a dynamic disproportion of CTLA4 versus CD3G expression in samples from at-risk, new-onset and long-term T1D patients.

Instead of working in a combinatorial space, we use hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), an expressive class of graphical models with log-concave density functions over continuous variables, which can represent confidences in discrete predictions. This paper demonstrates that HL-MRFs are general tools for fast and accurate structured prediction. We introduce the first inference algorithm that is both scalable and applicable to the full class of HL-MRFs, and show how to train HL-MRFs with several learning algorithms.

Many important problem areas are both richly structured and large scale, from social and biological networks, to knowledge graphs and the Web, to images, video, and natural language. In this paper, we introduce two new formalisms for modeling structured data, and show that they can both capture rich structure and scale to big data. The first, hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic graphical model that generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite three approaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and fuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference objective. We then define HL-MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The second new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic programming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on first-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable variable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the parameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous discrete models, but much more scalable. Together, these algorithms enable HL-MRFs and PSL to model rich, structured data at scales not previously possible.},

	abstract = {The first steps of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) infection were previously described. The virus binds to target cells by use of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and interacts with the ACE2 protein. Subsequent events, including virus internalization and trafficking, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we mapped the process of HCoV-NL63 entry into the LLC-Mk2 cell line and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) tracheobronchial tissue. Using a variety of techniques, we have shown that HCoV-NL63 virions require endocytosis for successful entry into the LLC-MK2 cells, and interaction between the virus and the ACE2 molecule triggers recruitment of clathrin. Subsequent vesicle scission by dynamin results in virus internalization, and the newly formed vesicle passes the actin cortex, which requires active cytoskeleton rearrangement. Finally, acidification of the endosomal microenvironment is required for successful fusion and release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For 3D tracheobronchial tissue cultures, we also observed that the virus enters the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but we obtained results suggesting that this pathway may be bypassed.},

Diagnosing disease, which is often the first step in a cure, has seen a sea change from the discerning hands of the neighborhood physician to the use of sophisticated machines to use of information gleaned from biomarkers obtained by the most minimally invasive of means. The last 100 or so years have borne witness to the enormous success story of allopathy, a practice that found favor over earlier practices of medical purgatory and homeopathy. Nevertheless, failures of this approach coupled with the omics and bioinformatics revolution spurred precision medicine, a platform wherein the molecular profile of an individual patient drives the selection of therapy. Indeed, precision medicine-based therapies that first found their place in oncology are rapidly finding uses in autoimmune, renal and other diseases. More recently a new renaissance that is shaping everyday life is making its way into healthcare. Drug discovery and medicine that started with Ayurveda in India are now benefiting from an altogether different artificial intelligence (AI)-one which is automating the invention of new chemical entities and the mining of large databases in health-privacy-protected vaults. Indeed, disciplines as diverse as language, neurophysiology, chemistry, toxicology, biostatistics, medicine and computing have come together to harness algorithms based on transfer learning and recurrent neural networks to design novel drug candidates, a priori inform on their safety, metabolism and clearance, and engineer their delivery but only on demand, all the while cataloging and comparing omics signatures across traditionally classified diseases to enable basket treatment strategies. This review highlights inroads made and being made in directed-drug design and molecular therapy.},

We show that our method, convolutional neural network for coexpression (CNNC), improves upon prior methods in tasks ranging from predicting transcription factor targets to identifying disease-related genes to causality inference. CNNC's encoding provides insights about some of the decisions it makes and their biological basis.

	abstract = {Automatic music recommendation has become an increasingly relevant problem in recent years, since a lot of music is now sold and consumed digitally. Most recommender systems rely on collaborative filtering. However, this approach suffers from the cold start problem: it fails when no usage data is available, so it is not effective for recommending new and unpopular songs. In this paper, we propose to use a latent factor model for recommendation, and predict the latent factors from music audio when they cannot be obtained from usage data. We compare a traditional approach using a bag-of-words representation of the audio signals with deep convolutional neural networks, and evaluate the predictions quantitatively and qualitatively on the Million Song Dataset. We show that using predicted latent factors produces sensible recommendations, despite the fact that there is a large semantic gap between the characteristics of a song that affect user preference and the corresponding audio signal. We also show that recent advances in deep learning translate very well to the music recommendation setting, with deep con-volutional neural networks significantly outperforming the traditional approach.},

In this study, we performed Western blot analysis to investigate whether the Na-K-Cl and K-Cl cotransporter protein is abnormally expressed in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex in patients with schizophrenia versus a control group. We found decreased K-Cl cotransporter protein expression in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, but not the anterior cingulate cortex, in subjects with schizophrenia, supporting the hypothesis of region level abnormal GABAergic function in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Subjects with schizophrenia off antipsychotic medication at the time of death had decreased K-Cl cotransporter protein expression compared to both normal controls and subjects with schizophrenia on antipsychotics. Our results provide evidence for KCC2 protein abnormalities in schizophrenia and suggest that antipsychotic medications might reverse deficits of this protein in the illness.},

We need to provide confidence measures on features of these networks: Is the existence of an edge between two nodes warranted? Is the Markov blanket of a given node robust? Can we say something about the ordering of the variables? We should be able to address these questions, even when the amount of data is not enough to induce a high scoring network. In this paper we propose Efron's Bootstrap as a computationally efficient approach for answering these questions. In addition, we propose to use these confidence measures to induce better structures from the data, and to detect the presence of latent variables.},

The severity of infections is due to an activation cascade that will lead to an autoamplifying cytokine production: the cytokine storm. Cytokines are a broad category of relatively small proteins ({\textless}40 kDa) that are produced and released with the aim of cell signaling. Our understanding of the processes that trigger this tremendous amount of cytokine production has made dramatic progress over the last decades, but unfortunately, these findings could not translate yet into effective treatments; so far, all clinical trials targeting cytokine production or effects failed. This review aims to summarize the pathophysiology of the cytokine storm; to describe the type, effects, and kinetics of cytokine production; and to discuss the therapeutic challenges of targeting cytokines. New promising therapeutic strategies focusing on the endothelium, as a source and a target of cytokines, are described.},

Here, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex structure shows that only one receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoprotein binds ACE2 and adopts a protruding “up” conformation. In addition, we studied the structures of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 in different in vitro conditions, which may mimic different conformational states of the S glycoprotein during virus entry. Disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from some of the prefusion spikes was observed and characterized. We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment. However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre- to postfusion conformational transition.},

	abstract = {Background: The acceptance of microarray technology in regulatory decision-making is being challenged by the existence of various platforms and data analysis methods. A recent report (E. Marshall, Science, 306, 630-631, 2004), by extensively citing the study of Tan et al. (Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 5676-5684, 2003), portrays a disturbingly negative picture of the cross-platform comparability, and, hence, the reliability of microarray technology. Results: We reanalyzed Tan's dataset and found that the intra-platform consistency was low, indicating a problem in experimental procedures from which the dataset was generated. Furthermore, by using three gene selection methods (i.e., p-value ranking, fold-change ranking, and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)) on the same dataset we found that p-value ranking (the method emphasized by Tan et al.) results in much lower cross-platform concordance compared to fold-change ranking or SAM. Therefore, the low cross-platform concordance reported in Tan's study appears to be mainly due to a combination of low intra-platform consistency and a poor choice of data analysis procedures, instead of inherent technical differences among different platforms, as suggested by Tan et al. and Marshall. Conclusion: Our results illustrate the importance of establishing calibrated RNA samples and reference datasets to objectively assess the performance of different microarray platforms and the proficiency of individual laboratories as well as the merits of various data analysis procedures. Thus, we are progressively coordinating the MAQC project, a community-wide effort for microarray quality control.},

A formidable challenge is the dissection of gene regulatory networks to delineate how eukaryotic cells coordinate and govern patterns of gene expression that ultimately lead to a phenotype. In this paper, we review several approaches for modeling eukaryotic gene regulatory networks and for reverse engineering such networks from experimental observations. Since we are interested in elucidating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of colon cancer progression, we use this important biological problem to illustrate various aspects of modeling gene regulation. We discuss four important models: gene networks, transcriptional regulatory systems, Boolean networks, and dynamical Bayesian networks. We review state-of-the-art functional genomics techniques, such as gene expression profiling, cis-regulatory element identification, TF target gene identification, and gene silencing by RNA interference, which can be used to extract information about gene regulation. We can employ this information, in conjunction with appropriately designed reverse engineering algorithms, to construct a computational model of gene regulation that sufficiently predicts experimental observations. In the last part of this review, we focus on the problem of reverse engineering transcriptional regulatory networks by gene perturbations. We mathematically formulate this problem and discuss the role of experimental resolution in our ability to reconstruct accurate models of gene regulation. We conclude, by discussing a promising approach for inferring a transcriptional regulatory system from microarray data obtained by gene perturbations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73\%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32\%]), including diabetes (eight [20\%]), hypertension (six [15\%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15\%]). Median age was 49.0 years (IQR 41.0-58.0). 27 (66\%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98\%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76\%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44\%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28\%] of 39), headache (three [8\%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5\%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3\%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55\%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]). 26 (63\%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29\%]), RNAaemia (six [15\%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12\%]) and secondary infection (four [10\%]). 13 (32\%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15\%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFalpha. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

	abstract = {Causal Structure Discovery (CSD) is the problem of identifying causal relationships from large quantities of data through computational methods. With the limited ability of traditional association-based computational methods to discover causal relationships, CSD methodologies are gaining popularity. The goal of the study was to systematically examine whether (i) CSD methods can discover the known causal relationships from observational clinical data and (ii) to offer guidance to accurately discover known causal relationships. We used Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a complex progressive disease, as a model because the well-established evidence provides a “gold-standard” causal graph for evaluation. We evaluated two CSD methods, Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Fast Greedy Equivalence Search (FGES) in their ability to discover this structure from data collected by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used structural equation models (which is not designed for CSD) as control. We applied these methods under three scenarios defined by increasing amounts of background knowledge provided to the methods. The methods were evaluated by comparing the resulting causal relationships with the “gold standard” graph that was constructed from literature. Dedicated CSD methods managed to discover graphs that nearly coincided with the gold standard. For best results, CSD algorithms should be used with longitudinal data providing as much prior knowledge as possible.},

	title = {Budgeted online collective inference},
	abstract = {Updating inference in response to new evidence is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Many real problems require large probabilistic graphical models, containing millions of interdependent variables. For such large models, jointly updating the most likely (i.e., MAP) configuration of the variables each time new evidence is encountered can be infeasible, even if inference is tractable. In this paper, we introduce budgeted online collective inference, in which the MAP configuration of a graphical model is updated efficiently by revising the assignments to a subset of the variables while holding others fixed. The goal is to selectively update certain variables without sacrificing quality with respect to full inference. To formalize the consequences of partially updating inference, we introduce the concept of inference regret. We derive inference regret bounds for a class of graphical models with strongly-convex free energies. These theoretical insights, combined with a thorough analysis of the optimization solver, motivate new approximate methods for efficiently updating the variable assignments under a budget constraint. In experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithms can reduce inference time by 65\% with accuracy comparable to full inference.},

	abstract = {In many multivariate domains, we are interested in analyzing the dependency structure of the underlying distribution, e.g., whether two variables are in direct interaction. We can represent dependency structures using Bayesian network models. To analyze a given data set, Bayesian model selection attempts to find the most likely (MAP) model, and uses its structure to answer these questions. However, when the amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number of networks that are consistent with a fixed order over network variables. This allows us to compute, for a given order, both the marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orders rather than over network structures. The space of orders is smaller and more regular than the space of structures, and has much a smoother posterior "landscape". We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach.},

	abstract = {It is well known in the literature that the problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks is very hard to tackle: its computational complexity is super-exponential in the number of nodes in the worst case and polynomial in most real-world scenarios. Efficient implementations of score-based structure learning benefit from past and current research in optimisation theory, which can be adapted to the task by using the network score as the objective function to maximise. This is not true for approaches based on conditional independence tests, called constraint-based learning algorithms. The only optimisation in widespread use, backtracking, leverages the symmetries implied by the definitions of neighbourhood and Markov blanket. In this paper we illustrate how backtracking is implemented in recent versions of the bnlearn R package, and how it degrades the stability of Bayesian network structure learning for little gain in terms of speed. As an alternative, we describe a software architecture and framework that can be used to parallelise constraint-based structure learning algorithms (also implemented in bnlearn) and we demonstrate its performance using four reference networks and two real-world data sets from genetics and systems biology. We show that on modern multi-core or multiprocessor hardware parallel implementations are preferable over backtracking, which was developed when single-processor machines were the norm.},

Plasma OT concentrations were measured following intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of vehicle, Ang II, or Ang II following pretreatment with a selective AT1 (Losartan) or AT2 (PD 123319) receptor antagonist. Furthermore, we measured Ang II-induced OT release during central α-adrenergic receptor blockade (phentolamine). Finally, plasma OT concentrations before and during suckling were evaluated following central administration of Ang II receptor antagonists. The increase in systemic OT following central Ang II was abolished by AT1 receptor blockade and inhibited by the AT2 receptor antagonist. Furthermore, pretreatment with phentolamine significantly diminished systemic OT release in response to icv Ang II. Finally, central Ang II receptor blockade did not alter the increase in circulating OT during suckling. These data demonstrate that Ang II evoked OT release is mediated through activation of both AT1 and AT2 receptors and suggest that a component of Ang II-induced OT stimulation is due to norepinephrine release. Furthermore, central angiotensin systems do not have a direct role in stimulating OT release during suckling. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we detail a multistep procedure for identifying potential key drivers of complex traits that integrates DNA-variation and gene-expression data with other complex trait data in segregating mouse populations. Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent, causative or reactive function relative to the complex traits under consideration. We show that this approach can predict transcriptional responses to single gene-perturbation experiments using gene-expression data in the context of a segregating mouse population. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying and experimentally validating the involvement of three new genes in susceptibility to obesity.},

We determined that deletion or depletion of CUL9 protein causes aberrant formation of neural rosettes, an {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} model of early neuralization. In this study, we applied mass spectrometric approaches in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) to identify CUL9 related signaling pathways that may contribute to this phenotype. Through LC-MS/MS analysis of immunoprecipitated endogenous CUL9, we identified several subunits of the APC/C, a major cell cycle regulator, as potential CUL9 interacting proteins. Knockdown of the APC/C adapter protein FZR1 resulted in a significant increase in CUL9 protein levels, however, CUL9 does not appear to affect protein abundance of APC/C subunits and adapters or alter cell cycle progression. Quantitative proteomic analysis of CUL9 KO hPSCs and hNPCs identified protein networks related to metabolic, ubiquitin degradation, and transcriptional regulation pathways that are disrupted by CUL9 deletion in both hPSCs. No significant changes in oxygen consumption rates or ATP production were detected in either cell type. The results of our study build on current evidence that CUL9 may have unique functions in different cell types and that compensatory mechanisms may contribute to the difficulty of identifying CUL9 substrates. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5–7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6\% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96\% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The activation and differentiation of T-cells are mainly directly by their co-regulatory receptors. T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and programed cell death-1 (PD-1) are two of the most important co-regulatory receptors. Binding of PD-1 and CTLA-4 with their corresponding ligands programed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and B7 on the antigen presenting cells (APC) activates two central co-inhibitory signaling pathways to suppress T cell functions. Interestingly, recent experiments have identified a new {\textless}italic{\textgreater}cis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -interaction between PD-L1 and B7, suggesting that a crosstalk exists between two co-inhibitory receptors and the two pairs of ligand-receptor complexes can undergo dynamic oligomerization. Inspired by these experimental evidences, we developed a coarse-grained model to characterize the assembling of an immune complex consisting of CLTA-4, B7, PD-L1 and PD-1. These four proteins and their interactions form a small network motif. The temporal dynamics and spatial pattern formation of this network was simulated by a diffusion-reaction algorithm. Our simulation method incorporates the membrane confinement of cell surface proteins and geometric arrangement of different binding interfaces between these proteins. A wide range of binding constants was tested for the interactions involved in the network. Interestingly, we show that the CTLA-4/B7 ligand-receptor complexes can first form linear oligomers, while these oligomers further align together into two-dimensional clusters. Similar phenomenon has also been observed in other systems of cell surface proteins. Our test results further indicate that both co-inhibitory signaling pathways activated by B7 and PD-L1 can be down-regulated by the new {\textless}italic{\textgreater}cis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -interaction between these two ligands, consistent with previous experimental evidences. Finally, the simulations also suggest that the dynamic and the spatial properties of the immune complex assembly are highly determined by the energetics of molecular interactions in the network. Our study, therefore, brings new insights to the co-regulatory mechanisms of T cell activation. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We deployed a bioinformatics workflow to identify candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Using an “omics” repository, the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), we simultaneously probed transcriptomic signatures of putative COVID-19 drugs and publicly available SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines to identify novel therapeutics. We identified a shortlist of 20 candidate drugs: 8 are already under trial for the treatment of COVID-19, the remaining 12 have antiviral properties and 6 have antiviral efficacy against coronaviruses specifically, in vitro. All candidate drugs are either FDA approved or are under investigation. Our candidate drug findings are discordant with (i.e., reverse) SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome signatures generated in vitro, and a subset are also identified in transcriptome signatures generated from COVID-19 patient samples, like the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. Overall, our findings provide additional support for drugs that are already being explored as therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and identify promising novel targets that are worthy of further investigation.},

Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement.Results: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios.Conclusions: Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis web-based tool providing various types of visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists.

The application offers access to several omics databases and tools to let users explore research questions in silico. The application is designed to be user- friendly with a unified user interface, while also scalable by offering the option of uploading user-defined datasets. We demonstrate the application features with a starting query of a single gene (Disrupted in schizophrenia 1, DISC1) to assess its protein-protein interactions network. We then explore expression levels of the gene network across tissues and cell types in the brain, as well as across 34 schizophrenia versus control differential gene expression datasets.Conclusion Kaleidoscope provides easy access to several databases and tools under a unified user interface to explore research questions in silico.

In neuroscience, data-driven models of neural circuits that span multiple scales are increasingly being used to understand brain function in health and disease. But their adoption and reuse has been limited by the specialist knowledge required to evaluate and use them. To address this, we have developed Open Source Brain, a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species. Model structure and parameters can be automatically visualized and their dynamical properties explored through browser-based simulations. Infrastructure and tools for collaborative interaction, development, and testing are also provided. We demonstrate how existing components can be reused by constructing new models of inhibition-stabilized cortical networks that match recent experimental results. These features of Open Source Brain improve the accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of models and facilitate their reuse by the wider community. Open Source Brain is an online resource of neuronal and circuit models that enables browser-based visualization, analysis, and simulation. Gleeson et al. describe how the resource and tools for collaborative model development provide accessible, up-to-date models from different brain regions.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature24056},
	abstract = {Recent studies on the controllability of complex systems offer a powerful mathematical framework to systematically explore the structure-function relationship in biological, social, and technological networks. Despite theoretical advances, we lack direct experimental proof of the validity of these widely used control principles. Here we fill this gap by applying a control framework to the connectome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, allowing us to predict the involvement of each C. elegans neuron in locomotor behaviours. We predict that control of the muscles or motor neurons requires 12 neuronal classes, which include neuronal groups previously implicated in locomotion by laser ablation, as well as one previously uncharacterized neuron, PDB. We validate this prediction experimentally, finding that the ablation of PDB leads to a significant loss of dorsoventral polarity in large body bends. Importantly, control principles also allow us to investigate the involvement of individual neurons within each neuronal class. For example, we predict that, within the class of DD motor neurons, only three (DD04, DD05, or DD06) should affect locomotion when ablated individually. This prediction is also confirmed; single cell ablations of DD04 or DD05 specifically affect posterior body movements, whereas ablations of DD02 or DD03 do not. Our predictions are robust to deletions of weak connections, missing connections, and rewired connections in the current connectome, indicating the potential applicability of this analytical framework to larger and less well-characterized connectomes.},

It can be automated and analysis tools have become available and hence the technique has become widely used within the past few years. Signal-transduction routes rely mainly on the phosphorylation status of already available proteins; therefore kinases are central players in signal-transduction routes. The array technology can now also be used for the analysis of the kinome. To enable array analysis, consensus peptides for kinases are spot on a solid support. After incubation with cell lysates and in the presence of radioactive ATP, radioactive peptides can be visualized and the kinases that are active in the cells can be determined. The present paper reviews comprehensively the different kinome array platforms available and results obtained hitherto using such platforms. It will appear that this technology does not disappoint its high expectations and is especially powerful because of its species independence. Nevertheless, improvements are still possible and I shall also sketch future possible directions.},

	abstract = {Recent studies on RNA polymerase III (pol III) gene transcription have provided a new awareness of the molecular complexity of this process. Fortunately, while the number of transcription components has been increasing, fundamental similarities have emerged regarding the function of eukaryotic promoter elements and the factors that bind them to form preinitiation complexes. Among these, the ability of transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) and pol III to transcribe the Saccharomyces cerevisiae U6 gene suggests that the concept of a minimal pol II promoter comprising a TATA box and an initiator region has a parallel in the pol III system. Furthermore, for each of the three classes of eukaryotic RNA polymerase, the assembly of transcription preinitiation complexes and, to some extent, the nature of these complexes appears to be more similar than was previously anticipated. This work highlights the novel functions and transcriptional properties of newly identified pol III genes, discusses the diversity of pol III promoter structures and presents the notion that the exclusive use of extragenic promoters by some pol III genes (so-called type-3 genes) may have evolved since the divergence of yeast and higher eukaryotes. Additionally, recent progress is reviewed on the identification and cloning of subunits for TFIIIC and TFIIIB. Particular emphasis is given to two components of TFIIIB, the TATA-binding protein and a protein with TFIIB homology (PCF4), since the properties of these molecules suggest a model whereby the polymerase specificity of transcription complexes is determined.},

A stunning discovery made from RNA-Seq analyses is the unexpectedly high prevalence of RNA-editing events, many of which cannot be explained by known RNA-editing mechanisms. Over the past 6-7 years, substantial efforts have been made to maximize the potential of RNA-Seq data.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors examined research on effects, costs, and patient and caregiver views of pharmacological management strategies for Lewy body dementia. METHOD: Studies were identified through bibliographic databases, trials registers, gray literature, reference lists, and experts. The authors used the search terms "Lewy or parkinson" and "dementia" through March 2015 and used the following inclusion criteria: participants with diagnoses of Lewy body dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson's disease dementia (or participants' caregivers); investigation of pharmacological management strategies; outcome measures and test scores reported. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by at least two authors. Meta-analyses were conducted, and when studies could not be combined, summaries were provided. RESULTS: Forty-four studies examining 22 strategies were included in the review. Meta-analysis indicated beneficial effects of donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Rivastigmine, but not donepezil, was associated with greater risk of adverse events. Meta-analysis of memantine suggested that it is well tolerated but with few benefits. Descriptive summaries provide some evidence of benefits for galantamine, modafinil, levodopa, rotigotine, clozapine, duloxetine, clonazepam, ramelteon, gabapentin, zonisamide, and yokukansan. Piracetam, amantadine, selegiline, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and citalopram do not appear to be effective. CONCLUSIONS: High-level evidence related to pharmacological strategies for managing Lewy body dementia is rare. Strategies for important areas of need in Lewy body dementia, such as autonomic symptoms and caregiver burden, have not been investigated, nor have the views of patients and caregivers about pharmacological strategies.},

	abstract = {This essay addresses two interrelated questions: What is the structure of current psychiatric science and what should its goals be? The author analyzed all studies addressing the etiology of psychiatric disorders in the first four 2013 issues of 12 psychiatry and psychology journals. He classified the resulting 197 articles by the risk factors examined using five biological, four psychological, and three environmental levels. The risk factors were widely dispersed across levels, suggesting that our field is inherently multilevel and already practicing empirically based pluralism. However, over two-thirds of the studies had a within-level focus. Two cross-level patterns emerged between 1) systems neuroscience and neuropsychology and 2) molecular or latent genetic factors and environmental risks. The author suggests three fundamental goals for etiological psychiatric research. The first is an eclectic effort to clarify risk factors regardless of level, including those assessed using imaginative understanding, with careful attention to causal inference. An interventionist framework focusing on isolating causal effects is recommended for this effort. The second goal is to clarify mechanisms of illness that will require tracing causal pathways across levels downward to biological neuroscience and upward to social factors, thereby elucidating the important cross-level interactions. Here the philosophy of biology literature on mechanisms can be a useful guide. Third, we have to trace the effects of these causal pathways back up into the mental realm, moving from the Jasperian level of explanation to that of understanding. This final effort will help us expand our empathic abilities to better understand how symptoms are experienced in the minds of our patients.},

However, its role in acute lung injury (ALI) has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects and potential mechanism action of OT on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Mice were treated with OT 30 min before the intraperitoneal injection of LPS. After 2 h, the effects of OT on lung histopathological changes, lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, levels of inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and expression of inflammation proteins were detected. The results showed that OT significantly reduced LPS-induced pathological injury, W/D ratio, MPO activity, and the levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and IL-6. Further, OT also inhibited LPS-induced Toll-like receptor 4 expression and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome activation. OT receptor antagonist (L-368,899) was given 90 min before injecting OT to further demonstrate the role of OT in LPS-induced ALI. The results showed OT could not alleviate the aforementioned inflammatory reactions after administering L-368,899. In conclusion, the present results indicated that OT could reduce inflammatory responses of LPS-induced ALI.},

A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

This paper deals with a comprehensive classification of challenges in drug repurposing. METHOD Initially, a classification of various existing repurposing models is propounded. Next, the benefits of drug repurposing are summarized. Further, a categorization for computational drug repurposing shortcomings is presented. Finally, the methods are evaluated based on their strength to addressing the drawbacks. RESULTS This work can offer a desirable platform for comparing the computational repurposing methods by measuring the methods in light of these challenges. CONCLUSION A proper comparison could prepare guidance for a genuine understanding of methods. Accordingly, this comprehension of the methods will help researchers eliminate the barriers thereby developing and improving methods.

We observed a global bias for hypoediting in ASD brains, which was shared across brain regions and involved many synaptic genes. We show that the Fragile X proteins FMRP and FXR1P interact with RNA-editing enzymes (ADAR proteins) and modulate A-to-I editing. Furthermore, we observed convergent patterns of RNA-editing alterations in ASD and Fragile X syndrome, establishing this as a molecular link between these related diseases. Our findings, which are corroborated across multiple data sets, including dup15q (genomic duplication of 15q11.2-13.1) cases associated with intellectual disability, highlight RNA-editing dysregulation in ASD and reveal new mechanisms underlying this disorder.},

	abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS - the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases - make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {Aim: Oxytocin administration to diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents, monkeys and humans decreases body weight and fat mass with concomitant improvements in glucose metabolism. Moreover, several studies show an immunomodulatory role of oxytocin in a number of settings (such as atherosclerosis, injury, sepsis). This study aims to shed some light on the effects of oxytocin on macrophage polarization and cytokine production, as well as its possible impact on these parameters in adipose tissue in DIO mice with impaired glucose metabolism. Methods: Mouse bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages and treated with oxytocin. Macrophage proliferation, cytokine secretion and macrophage populations were determined. For experiments in vivo, DIO mice were treated with oxytocin for 2 weeks. Body weight and composition and glucose tolerance were subsequently followed. At the end of treatment, adipose tissue macrophage populations, plasma cytokine levels and cytokine expression in adipose tissue were determined. Results: In bone marrow-derived macrophages, oxytocin induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype (decreased M1/M2 ratio). In M1-derived macrophages, oxytocin decreased TNFα secretion, with no effects on the other cytokines tested nor any effect on cytokine secretion by M2-derived macrophages. Oxytocin treatment in DIO mice in vivo led to decreased body weight accompanied by an improvement in glucose tolerance, with no changes in plasma cytokine levels. In adipose tissue, oxytocin decreased Tnfα expression without modifying the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Conclusion: Oxytocin treatment decreases TNFα production both in vitro (in bone marrow-derived macrophages) and in vivo (in epididymal adipose tissue) in DIO mice. This effect may also be contributory to the observed improvement in glucose metabolism.},

In this paper we demonstrate how deep neural networks (DNN) trained on large transcriptional response data sets can classify various drugs to therapeutic categories solely based on their transcriptional profiles. We used the perturbation samples of 678 drugs across A549, MCF-7, and PC-3 cell lines from the LINCS Project and linked those to 12 therapeutic use categories derived from MeSH. To train the DNN, we utilized both gene level transcriptomic data and transcriptomic data processed using a pathway activation scoring algorithm, for a pooled data set of samples perturbed with different concentrations of the drug for 6 and 24 hours. In both pathway and gene level classification, DNN achieved high classification accuracy and convincingly outperformed the support vector machine (SVM) model on every multiclass classification problem, however, models based on pathway level data performed significantly better. For the first time we demonstrate a deep learning neural net trained on transcriptomic data to recognize pharmacological properties of multiple drugs across different biological systems and conditions. We also propose using deep neural net confusion matrices for drug repositioning. This work is a proof of principle for applying deep learning to drug discovery and development.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Childhood maltreatment increases risk for psychopathology. For some highly prevalent disorders (major depression, substance abuse, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder) a substantial subset of individuals have a history of maltreatment and a substantial subset do not. The authors examined the evidence to assess whether those with a history of maltreatment represent a clinically and biologically distinct subtype.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHOD: The authors reviewed the literature on maltreatment as a risk factor for these disorders and on the clinical differences between individuals with and without a history of maltreatment who share the same diagnoses. Neurobiological findings in maltreated individuals were reviewed and compared with findings reported for these disorders.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Maltreated individuals with depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders have an earlier age at onset, greater symptom severity, more comorbidity, a greater risk for suicide, and poorer treatment response than nonmaltreated individuals with the same diagnoses. Imaging findings associated with these disorders, such as reduced hippocampal volume and amygdala hyperreactivity, are more consistently observed in maltreated individuals and may represent a maltreatment-related risk factor. Maltreated individuals also differ from others as a result of epigenetic modifications and genetic polymorphisms that interact with experience to increase risk for psychopathology.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic expression of psychopathology may be strongly influenced by exposure to maltreatment, leading to a constellation of ecophenotypes. While these ecophenotypes fit within conventional diagnostic boundaries, they likely represent distinct subtypes. Recognition of this distinction may be essential in determining the biological bases of these disorders. Treatment guidelines and algorithms may be enhanced if maltreated and nonmaltreated individuals with the same diagnostic labels are differentiated.},

	abstract = {RNA editing enhances the diversity of gene products at the post-transcriptional level. Approaches for genome-wide identification of RNA editing face two main challenges: separating true editing sites from false discoveries and accurate estimation of editing levels. We developed an approach to analyze transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq) for global identification of RNA editing in cells for which whole-genome sequencing data are available. We applied the method to analyze RNA-seq data of a human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG. Around 10,000 DNA-RNA differences were identified, the majority being putative A-to-I editing sites. These predicted A-to-I events were associated with a low false-discovery rate (∼5\%). Moreover, the estimated editing levels from RNA-seq correlated well with those based on traditional clonal sequencing. Our results further facilitated unbiased characterization of the sequence and evolutionary features flanking predicted A-to-I editing sites and discovery of a conserved RNA structural motif that may be functionally relevant to editing. Genes with predicted A-to-I editing were significantly enriched with those known to be involved in cancer, supporting the potential importance of cancer-specific RNA editing. A similar profile of DNA-RNA differences as in U87MG was predicted for another RNA-seq data set obtained from primary breast cancer samples. Remarkably, significant overlap exists between the putative editing sites of the two transcriptomes despite their difference in cell type, cancer type, and genomic backgrounds. Our approach enabled de novo identification of the RNA editome, which sets the stage for further mechanistic studies of this important step of post-transcriptional regulation. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {Background: The fundamental pathologic processes associated with schizophrenia remain uncertain. Objective: The goal of this article was to review imaging evidence suggesting that schizophrenia is associated with excessive stimulation of D2 receptors, as well as imaging experiments supporting the hypothesis that this dysregulation might be secondary to N- methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) dysfunction. Conclusions: Recent imaging data support the association of schizophrenia with a dopamine endophenotype involving excessive subcortical dopamine function. Animal and imaging data are consistent with the idea that this abnormality might be secondary to a synaptic disconnectivity involving the prefrontal cortex, which is well modeled by NMDA antagonist administration. In turn, this dopamine dysregulation might worsen synaptic connectivity and NMDA function. Thus, both glutamate/dopamine and dopamine/glutamate interactions may be relevant to schizophrenia pathophysiology and treatment. A deficit in glutamate transmission may lead to the dopamine endophenotype associated with this illness, and dopamine alterations in turn might exacerbate glutamate transmission deficits. The view that NMDA alterations are primary and dopamine alterations are secondary is probably oversimplistic, as both sets of abnormalities reinforce each other. A consequence of this general model is that direct intervention to support NMDA function might be beneficial as an augmentation strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia. Thus, it is proposed that schizophrenia is associated with strongly interconnected abnormalities of glutamate and dopamine transmission: NMDA hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex and its connections might generate a pattern of dysregulation of dopamine systems that, in turn, further weakens NMDA-mediated connectivity and plasticity.

RESULTS Bipolar disorder can be conceptualized, in neural circuitry terms, as parallel dysfunction in prefrontal cortical (especially ventrolateral prefrontal cortical)-hippocampal-amygdala emotion-processing and emotion-regulation circuits bilaterally, together with an "overactive" left-sided ventral striatal-ventrolateral and orbitofrontal cortical reward-processing circuitry, resulting in characteristic behavioral abnormalities associated with bipolar disorder: emotional lability, emotional dysregulation, and heightened reward sensitivity. A potential structural basis for these functional abnormalities is gray matter volume decreases in the prefrontal and temporal cortices, the amygdala, and the hippocampus and fractional anisotropy decreases in white matter tracts connecting prefrontal and subcortical regions. CONCLUSIONS Neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorder clearly demonstrate abnormalities in neural circuits supporting emotion processing, emotion regulation, and reward processing, although there are several limitations to these studies. Future neuroimaging research in bipolar disorder should include studies adopting dimensional approaches; larger studies examining neurodevelopmental trajectories in youths with bipolar disorder or at risk for bipolar disorder; multimodal neuroimaging studies using integrated systems approaches; and studies using pattern recognition approaches to provide clinically useful individual-level data. Such studies will help identify clinically relevant biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment decision making for individuals with bipolar disorder.},

A comprehensive set of several hundred human RNA editing sites was detected by comparing genomic DNA with RNAs from seven tissues of a single individual. Specificity of our profiling was supported by observations of enrichment with known features of targets of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) and validation by means of capillary sequencing. This efficient approach greatly expands the repertoire of RNA editing targets and can be applied to studies involving RNA editing-related human diseases.},

Applied to 14,000+ compounds without known targets, BANDIT generated {\textasciitilde}4,000 previously unknown molecule-target predictions. From this set we validate 14 novel microtubule inhibitors, including 3 with activity on resistant cancer cells. We applied BANDIT to ONC201—an anti-cancer compound in clinical development whose target had remained elusive. We identified and validated DRD2 as ONC201’s target, and this information is now being used for precise clinical trial design. Finally, BANDIT identifies connections between different drug classes, elucidating previously unexplained clinical observations and suggesting new drug repositioning opportunities. Overall, BANDIT represents an efficient and accurate platform to accelerate drug discovery and direct clinical application.},

	abstract = {Although it has long been recognized that many individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also have difficulties with emotion regulation, no consensus has been reached on how to conceptualize this clinically challenging domain. The authors examine the current literature using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Three key findings emerge. First, emotion dysregulation is prevalent in ADHD throughout the lifespan and is a major contributor to impairment. Second, emotion dysregulation in ADHD may arise from deficits in orienting toward, recognizing, and/or allocating attention to emotional stimuli; these deficits implicate dysfunction within a striato-amygdalo-medial prefrontal cortical network. Third, while current treatments for ADHD often also ameliorate emotion dysregulation, a focus on this combination of symptoms reframes clinical questions and could stimulate novel therapeutic approaches. The authors then consider three models to explain the overlap between emotion dysregulation and ADHD: emotion dysregulation and ADHD are correlated but distinct dimensions; emotion dysregulation is a core diagnostic feature of ADHD; and the combination constitutes a nosological entity distinct from both ADHD and emotion dysregulation alone. The differing predictions from each model can guide research on the much-neglected population of patients with ADHD and emotion dysregulation.},

Here, we describe a data resource, the Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK; https://darkkinome.org), that is specifically focused on providing data and reagents for these understudied kinases to the broader research community. Supported through NIH’s Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Program, the DKK is focused on data and knowledge generation for 162 poorly studied or ‘dark’ kinases. Types of data provided through the DKK include parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) peptides for quantitative proteomics, protein interactions, NanoBRET reagents, and kinase-specific compounds. Higher-level data is similarly being generated and consolidated such as tissue gene expression profiles and, longer-term, functional relationships derived through perturbation studies. Associated web tools that help investigators interrogate both internal and external data are also provided through the site. As an evolving resource, the DKK seeks to continually support and enhance knowledge on these potentially high-impact druggable targets.},

A substantial fraction of the human kinome is nonetheless understudied. In this perspective, members of the NIH Understudied Kinome Consortium mine publicly available databases to assess the functionality of these understudied kinases as well as their potential to be therapeutic targets for drug discovery campaigns. We start with a re-analysis of the kinome as a whole and describe criteria for creating an inclusive set of 710 kinase domains as well as a curated set of 557 protein kinase like (PKL) domains. We define an understudied (dark) kinome by quantifying the public knowledge on each kinase with a PKL domain using an automatic reading machine. We find a substantial number are essential in the Cancer Dependency Map and differentially expressed or mutated in disease databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas. Based on this and other data, it seems likely that the dark kinome contains biologically important genes, a subset of which may be viable drug targets.

The data further illustrate that selective inhibitors have been developed against the majority of kinases targeted by the compounds tested. Analysis of the interaction patterns reveals a class of 'group-selective' inhibitors broadly active against a single subfamily of kinases, but selective outside that subfamily. The data set suggests compounds to use as tools to study kinases for which no dedicated inhibitors exist. It also provides a foundation for further exploring kinase inhibitor biology and toxicity, as well as for studying the structural basis of the observed interaction patterns.

Currently, quantitative whole-proteome profiling often relies on non-targeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which samples proteoforms broadly, but can suffer from lower accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility compared with targeted LC-MS. Recent advances in bottom-up proteomics using targeted LC-MS have enabled previously unachievable identification and quantification of target proteins and posttranslational modifications within complex samples. Consequently, targeted LC-MS is rapidly advancing biomedical research, especially systems biology research in diverse areas that include proteogenomics, interactomics, kinomics, and biological pathway modeling. With the recent development of targeted LC-MS assays for nearly the entire human proteome, targeted LC-MS is positioned to enable quantitative proteomic profiling of unprecedented quality and accessibility to support fundamental and clinical research. Here we review recent applications of bottom-up proteomics using targeted LC-MS for systems biology research. Significance: Advances in targeted proteomics are rapidly advancing systems biology research. Recent applications include systems-level investigations focused on posttranslational modifications (such as phosphoproteomics), protein conformation, protein-protein interaction, kinomics, proteogenomics, and metabolic and signaling pathways. Notably, absolute quantification of metabolic and signaling pathway proteins has enabled accurate pathway modeling and engineering. Integration of targeted proteomics with other technologies, such as RNA-seq, has facilitated diverse research such as the identification of hundreds of “missing” human proteins (genes and transcripts that appear to encode proteins but direct experimental evidence was lacking).},

There are more than 500 human protein kinases and about 20 lipid kinases. Most protein kinases share a highly conserved domain, the eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) domain, which contains the ATP and substrate-binding sites. Many inhibitors in clinical use bind to the highly conserved ATP binding site. For this reason, many kinase inhibitors are not exclusively selective for their intended targets. Furthermore, despite the current interest in kinase inhibitors, very few kinases implicated in disease have validated inhibitors.

Nonorthologous kinases arise only by retrotransposition and gene decay. Orthologous kinase pairs vary in sequence conservation along their length, creating a map of functionally important regions for every kinase pair. Many species-specific sequence inserts exist and are frequently alternatively spliced, allowing for the creation of evolutionary lineage-specific functions.

	abstract = {The eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) domain mediates the majority of signaling and coordination of complex events in eukaryotes. By contrast, most bacterial signaling is thought to occur through structurally unrelated histidine kinases, though some ePK-like kinases (ELKs) and small molecule kinases are known in bacteria. Our analysis of the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) dataset reveals that ELKs are as prevalent as histidine kinases and may play an equally important role in prokaryotic behavior. By combining GOS and public databases, we show that the ePK is just one subset of a diverse superfamily of enzymes built on a common protein kinase-like (PKL) fold. We explored this huge phylogenetic and functional space to cast light on the ancient evolution of this superfamily, its mechanistic core, and the structural basis for its observed diversity. We cataloged 27,677 ePKs and 18,699 ELKs, and classified them into 20 highly distinct families whose known members suggest regulatory functions. GOS data more than tripled the count of ELK sequences and enabled the discovery of novel families and classification and analysis of all ELKs. Comparison between and within families revealed ten key residues that are highly conserved across families. However, all but one of the ten residues has been eliminated in one family or another, indicating great functional plasticity. We show that loss of a catalytic lysine in two families is compensated by distinct mechanisms both involving other key motifs. This diverse superfamily serves as a model for further structural and functional analysis of enzyme evolution. © 2007 Kannan et al.},

By exploring chirality within the kinome, a new iteration of kinase inhibitors is being developed to better utilize the three-dimensional nature of the kinase active site.

We, therefore, developed a real-time framework, called Neural Interactome 1, 2 , to simultaneously visualize and interact with the structure and dynamics of such networks. Neural Interactome is a cross-platform framework, which combines graph visualization with the simulation of neural dynamics, or experimentally recorded multi neural time series, to allow application of stimuli to neurons to examine network responses. In addition, Neural Interactome supports structural changes, such as disconnection of neurons from the network (ablation feature). Neural dynamics can be explored on a single neuron level (using a zoom feature), back in time (using a review feature), and recorded (using presets feature). The development of the Neural Interactome was guided by generic concepts to be applicable to neuronal networks with different neural connectivity and dynamics. We implement the framework using a model of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode, a model organism with resolved connectome and neural dynamics. We show that Neural Interactome assists in studying neural response patterns associated with locomotion and other stimuli. In particular, we demonstrate how stimulation and ablation help in identifying neurons that shape particular dynamics.

	abstract = {Neuropeptide signalling has been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes in diverse organisms, from invertebrates to humans. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome has at least 154 neuropeptide precursor genes, encoding over 300 bioactive peptides. These neuromodulators are thought to largely signal beyond ‘wired’ chemical/electrical synapse connections, therefore creating a ‘wireless’ network for neuronal communication. Here, we investigated how behavioural states are affected by neuropeptide signalling through the G protein-coupled receptor SEB-3, which belongs to a bilaterian family of orphan secretin receptors. Using reverse pharmacology, we identified the neuropeptide NLP-49 as a ligand of this evolutionarily conserved neuropeptide receptor. Our findings demonstrate novel roles for NLP-49 and SEB-3 in locomotion, arousal and egg-laying. Specifically, high-content analysis of locomotor behaviour indicates that seb-3 and nlp-49 deletion mutants cause remarkably similar abnormalities in movement dynamics, which are reversed by overexpression of wild-type transgenes. Overexpression of NLP-49 in AVK interneurons leads to heightened locomotor arousal, an effect that is dependent on seb-3. Finally, seb-3 and nlp-49 mutants also show constitutive egg-laying in liquid medium and alter the temporal pattern of egg-laying in similar ways. Together, these results provide in vivo evidence that NLP-49 peptides act through SEB-3 to modulate behaviour, and highlight the importance of neuropeptide signalling in the control of behavioural states.},

We reveal a fundamental relationship between body elasticity and environmental drag in determining the dynamics of the body and demonstrate the manifestation of this relationship in the context of proprioceptively driven control. By considering characteristics unique to proprioceptive neurons, we predict the signatures of internal gait modulation that contrast with the known signatures of externally or biomechanically modulated gait. We further show that proprioceptive feedback can suppress neuromechanical phase lags during undulatory locomotion, contrasting with well studied advancing phase lags that have long been a signature of centrally generated, feed-forward control.

We review and discuss recent findings that address the origin of Caenorhabditis elegans motor rhythm. These studies propose that the A- and mid-body B-class excitatory motor neurons at the ventral cord function as non-bursting intrinsic oscillators to underlie body undulation during reversal and forward movements, respectively. Proprioception entrains their intrinsic activities, allows phase-coupling between members of the same class motor neurons, and thereby facilitates directional propagation of undulations. Distinct pools of premotor interneurons project along the ventral nerve cord to innervate all members of the A- and B-class motor neurons, modulating their oscillations, as well as promoting their bi-directional coupling. The two motor sub-circuits, which consist of oscillators and descending inputs with distinct properties, form the structural base of dynamic rhythmicity and flexible partition of the forward and backward motor states. These results contribute to a continuous effort to establish a mechanistic and dynamic model of the C. elegans sensorimotor system. C. elegans exhibits rich sensorimotor functions despite a small neuron number. These findings implicate a circuit-level functional compression. By integrating the role of rhythm generation and proprioception into motor neurons, and the role of descending regulation of oscillators into premotor interneurons, this numerically simple nervous system can achieve a circuit infrastructure analogous to that of anatomically complex systems. C. elegans has manifested itself as a compact model to search for general principles of sensorimotor behaviours.},

	abstract = {Control is essential to the functioning of any neural system. Indeed, under healthy conditions the brain must be able to continuously maintain a tight functional control between the system's inputs and outputs. One may therefore hypothesize that the brain's wiring is predetermined by the need to maintain control across multiple scales, maintaining the stability of key internal variables, and producing behaviour in response to environmental cues. Recent advances in network control have offered a powerful mathematical framework to explore the structure-function relationship in complex biological, social and technological networks, and are beginning to yield important and precise insights on neuronal systems. The network control paradigm promises a predictive, quantitative framework to unite the distinct datasets necessary to fully describe a nervous system, and provide mechanistic explanations for the observed structure and function relationships. Here, we provide a thorough review of the network control framework as applied to Caenorhabditis elegans (Yan et al. 2017 Nature 550, 519-523. (doi:10.1038/nature24056)), in the style of Frequently Asked Questions.

	abstract = {We propose an approach to represent neuronal network dynamics as a probabilistic graphical model (PGM). To construct the PGM, we collect time series of neuronal responses produced by the neuronal network and use singular value decomposition to obtain a low-dimensional projection of the timeseries data. We then extract dominant patterns from the projections to get pairwise dependency information and create a graphical model for the full network. The outcome model is a functional connectome that captures how stimuli propagate through the network and thus represents causal dependencies between neurons and stimuli. We apply our methodology to a model of the Caenorhabditis elegans somatic nervous system to validate and show an example of our approach. The structure and dynamics of the C. Elegans nervous system are well studied and a model that generates neuronal responses is available. The resulting PGM enables us to obtain and verify underlying neuronal pathways for known behavioural scenarios and detect possible pathways for novel scenarios.

	abstract = {Behaviour is a sensitive and integrative readout of nervous system function and therefore an attractive measure for assessing the effects of mutation or drug treatment on animals. Video data provide a rich but high-dimensional representation of behaviour, and so the first step of analysis is often some form of tracking and feature extraction to reduce dimensionality while maintaining relevant information. Modern machine-learning methods are powerful but notoriously difficult to interpret, while handcrafted features are interpretable but do not always perform as well. Here, we report a new set of handcrafted features to compactly quantify Caenorhabditis elegans behaviour. The features are designed to be interpretable but to capture as much of the phenotypic differences between worms as possible. We show that the full feature set is more powerful than a previously defined feature set in classifying mutant strains. We then use a combination of automated and manual feature selection to define a core set of interpretable features that still provides sufficient power to detect behavioural differences between mutant strains and the wild-type. Finally, we apply the new features to detect time-resolved behavioural differences in a series of optogenetic experiments targeting different neural subsets.

	abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a tractable model system to study locomotion, sensory navigation and decision-making. In its natural habitat, it is thought to navigate complex multisensory environments in order to find food and mating partners, while avoiding threats like predators or toxic environments. While research in past decades has shed much light on the functions and mechanisms of selected sensory neurons, we are just at the brink of understanding how sensory information is integrated by interneuron circuits for action selection in the worm. Recent technological advances have enabled whole-brain Ca2+ imaging and Ca2+ imaging of neuronal activity in freely moving worms. A common principle emerging across multiple studies is that most interneuron activities are tightly coupled to the worm's instantaneous behaviour; notably, these observations encompass neurons receiving direct sensory neuron inputs. The new findings suggest that in the C. Elegans brain, sensory and motor representations are integrated already at the uppermost sensory processing layers. Moreover, these results challenge a perhaps more intuitive view of sequential feedforward sensory pathways that converge onto premotor interneurons and motor neurons. We propose that sensorimotor integration occurs rather in a distributed dynamical fashion. In this perspective article, we will explore this view, discuss the challenges and implications of these discoveries on the interpretation and design of neural activity experiments, and discuss possible functions. Furthermore, we will discuss the broader context of similar findings in fruit flies and rodents, which suggest generalizable principles that can be learnt from this amenable nematode model organism.

	abstract = {Email: Wave propagation during locomotory movements of Caenorhabditis elegans is constrained to a single dorso/ventral plane. By contrast, the tip of the head (snout) can make rapid exploratory movements in all directions relative to the body axis. These extra degrees of freedom are probably important for animals to seek and identify desirable passages in the interstices of the three-dimensional matrix of soil particles, their usual habitat. The differences in degrees of freedom of movement between snout and body are reflected in the innervation of the musculature. Along the length of the body, the two quadrants of dorsal muscle receive common innervation as do the two quadrants of ventral muscle. By contrast, muscles in the snout have an octagonal arrangement of innervation. It is likely that the exploratory behaviour of the snout is mediated by octant-specific motor and sensory neurons, together with their associated interneurons. The well-defined anatomical structure and neural circuitry of the snout together with behavioural observations should facilitate the implementation of models of the neural basis of exploratory movements, which could lead to an understanding of the basis of this relatively complex behaviour, a behaviour that has similarities to foraging in some vertebrates.

Yet despite the breadth of knowledge about the neurobiology, anatomy and physics of C. elegans , there are still a number of unanswered questions about one of its most basic and fundamental behaviours: forward locomotion. How the rhythmic pattern is generated and propagated along the body is not yet well understood. We report on the development and analysis of a model of forward locomotion that integrates the neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and body mechanics of the worm. Our model is motivated by experimental analysis of the structure of the ventral cord circuitry and the effect of local body curvature on nearby motoneurons. We developed a neuroanatomically grounded model of the head motoneuron circuit and the ventral nerve cord circuit. We integrated the neural model with an existing biomechanical model of the worm's body, with updated musculature and stretch receptors. Unknown parameters were evolved using an evolutionary algorithm to match the speed of the worm on agar. We performed 100 evolutionary runs and consistently found electrophysiological configurations that reproduced realistic control of forward movement. The ensemble of successful solutions reproduced key experimental observations that they were not designed to fit, including the wavelength and frequency of the propagating wave. Analysis of the ensemble revealed that head motoneurons SMD and RMD are sufficient to drive dorsoventral undulations in the head and neck and that short-range posteriorly directed proprioceptive feedback is sufficient to propagate the wave along the rest of the body.},

Although theoretical propositions and some proof of concept experiments on directly linking the brains with machines date back to the early 1960s, BMI research only took off in earnest at the end of the 1990s, when this approach became intimately linked to new neurophysiological methods for sampling large-scale brain activity. The classic goals of BMIs are 1) to unveil and utilize principles of operation and plastic properties of the distributed and dynamic circuits of the brain and 2) to create new therapies to restore mobility and sensations to severely disabled patients. Over the past decade, a wide range of BMI applications have emerged, which considerably expanded these original goals. BMI studies have shown neural control over the movements of robotic and virtual actuators that enact both upper and lower limb functions. Furthermore, BMIs have also incorporated ways to deliver sensory feedback, generated from external actuators, back to the brain. BMI research has been at the forefront of many neurophysiological discoveries, including the demonstration that, through continuous use, artificial tools can be assimilated by the primate brain’s body schema. Work on BMIs has also led to the introduction of novel neurorehabilitation strategies. As a result of these efforts, long-term continuous BMI use has been recently implicated with the induction of partial neurological recovery in spinal cord injury patients.},

In light of recent progress in mapping neural function to behavior, we briefly and selectively review past and present endeavors to reveal and reconstruct nervous system function in Caenorhabditis elegans through simulation. Approach. Rather than presenting an all-encompassing review on the mathematical modeling of C. Elegans, this contribution collects snapshots of pathfinding key works and emerging technologies that recent single- and multi-center simulation initiatives are building on. We thereby point out a few general limitations and problems that these undertakings are faced with and discuss how these may be addressed and overcome. Main results. Lessons learned from past and current computational approaches to deciphering and reconstructing information flow in the C. Elegans nervous system corroborate the need of refining neural response models and linking them to intra- and extra-environmental interactions to better reflect and understand the actual biological, biochemical and biophysical events that lead to behavior. Together with single-center research efforts, the Si elegans and OpenWorm projects aim at providing the required, in some cases complementary tools for different hardware architectures to support advancement into this direction. Significance. Despite its seeming simplicity, the nervous system of the hermaphroditic nematode C. Elegans with just 302 neurons gives rise to a rich behavioral repertoire. Besides controlling vital functions (feeding, defecation, reproduction), it encodes different stimuli-induced as well as autonomous locomotion modalities (crawling, swimming and jumping). For this dichotomy between system simplicity and behavioral complexity, C. Elegans has challenged neurobiologists and computational scientists alike. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to a context-modulated functionality of individual neurons would not only advance our knowledge on nervous system function and its failure in pathological states, but have directly exploitable benefits for robotics and the engineering of brain-mimetic computational architectures that are orthogonal to current von-Neumann-type machines.},

	abstract = {To quantitatively understand chemosensory behaviors, it is desirable to present many animals with repeatable, well-defined chemical stimuli. To that end, we describe a microfluidic system to analyze Caenorhabditis elegans behavior in defined temporal and spatial stimulus patterns. A 2 cm Ã- 2 cm structured arena allowed C. elegans to perform crawling locomotion in a controlled liquid environment. We characterized behavioral responses to attractive odors with three stimulus patterns: temporal pulses, spatial stripes and a linear concentration gradient, all delivered in the fluid phase to eliminate variability associated with air-fluid transitions. Different stimulus configurations preferentially revealed turning dynamics in a biased random walk, directed orientation into an odor stripe and speed regulation by odor. We identified both expected and unexpected responses in wild-type worms and sensory mutants by quantifying dozens of behavioral parameters. The devices are inexpensive, easy to fabricate, reusable and suitable for delivering any liquid-borne stimulus. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.},

The real-world toxicogenomic data set reported here showed high concordance in intersite and cross-platform comparisons. Further, gene lists generated by fold-change ranking were more reproducible than those obtained by t-test P value or Significance Analysis of Microarrays. Finally, gene lists generated by fold-change ranking with a nonstringent P-value cutoff showed increased consistency in Gene Ontology terms and pathways, and hence the biological impact of chemical exposure could be reliably deduced from all platforms analyzed. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Background. Sepsis, commonly associated with enhanced generation of reactive oxygen metabolites, leads to multiple organ dysfunctions. The neurohypophyseal hormone oxytocin (OT), released during social contact, was recently shown to modulate the immune and inflammatory processes. We investigated the protective role of OT against sepsis-induced pelvic inflammation. Materials and methods. Under anesthesia, sepsis was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) by cecal ligation and perforation method. Sham-operated rats served as controls. Either saline or OT (1 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously immediately after and at the 16th hour, and rats were decapitated at the 24th hour of sepsis induction. Colon, uterus, and liver samples were obtained for the histopathological analysis of damage and for the measurement of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, indicating neutrophil infiltration, malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating lipid peroxidation, and glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant, levels. Results. Colonic, uterine and liver MDA levels in the sepsis group were significantly increased (P {\textless} 0.01-P {\textless} 0.001), while colonic and uterine GSH levels were decreased (P {\textless} 0.05-P {\textless} 0.01) when compared to the control group. OT treatment reversed the MDA and GSH levels back to the control levels, while hepatic GSH levels were not altered. MPO activity in the colon and liver was increased by sepsis (P {\textless} 0.05-P {\textless} 0.001) while OT treatment abolished the elevated MPO activity. Collagen levels in the uterus and liver were increased by sepsis (P {\textless} 0.01) and OT treatment reduced the collagen levels in both tissues (P {\textless} 0.01-P {\textless} 0.05). Serum TNF-α levels were significantly increased by sepsis (P {\textless} 0.001) and OT treatment abolished the sepsis-induced increase in TNF-α levels. Conclusions. OT protects against sepsis-induced oxidative damage by acting as an antioxidant agent and its protective effect in the colon and liver appears to be dependent on its inhibitory effect on neutrophil infiltration. Our results suggest that OT may have a therapeutic value in limiting sepsis-associated multiple organ damage. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We were able to detect a wide range of bacterial and archaeal phyla in blood. Interestingly, we observed an increased microbial diversity in schizophrenia patients compared to the three other groups. We replicated this finding in an independent schizophrenia case-control cohort. This increased diversity is inversely correlated with estimated cell abundance of a subpopulation of CD8+ memory T cells in healthy controls, supporting a link between microbial products found in blood, immunity and schizophrenia.},

We screened for HHV-6 detection across three independent AD brain repositories using (1) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets and (2) DNA samples extracted from AD and non-AD control brains. The RNA-seq data were screened for pathogens against taxon references from over 25,000 microbes, including 118 human viruses, whereas DNA samples were probed for PCR reactivity to HHV-6A and HHV-6B. HHV-6 demonstrated little specificity to AD brains over controls by either method, whereas other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), were detected at comparable levels. These direct methods of viral detection do not suggest an association between HHV-6 and AD.},

	abstract = {Innate immune response is a universal mechanism against invading pathogens. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), being part of a first line of defense, are responsible for detecting a variety of microorganisms. Among them TLR9, which is localized in endosomes, acts as a sensor for unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacteria, DNA viruses (e.g., HSV-1), or fungi. TLRs differ from one another by the use of accessory proteins. MyD88 adapter-like (Mal) adapter molecule is considered a positive regulator of TLR2- and TLR4-dependent pathways. It has been reported that this adapter may also negatively control signal transduction induced by TLR3 anchored in the endosome membrane. So far, the role of Mal adapter protein in the TLR9 signaling pathways has not been clarified. We show for the first time that Mal is engaged in TLR9-de-pendent expression of genes encoding IFNβ and TNFα in HSV-1-infected or CpG-C-treated macrophages and requires a noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Moreover, using inhibitor of ERK1/2 we confirmed involvement of these kinases in TLR9-dependent induction of IFNβ and TNFα. Our study points to a new role of Mal in TLR9 signaling through a hitherto unknown mechanism whereby lack of Mal specifically impairs ERK1/2-mediated induction of noncanonical NF-κB pathway and concomitant IFNβ and TNFα production.},

Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with prior experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement},

RNA editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter virus infection, but it is not yet known whether this process operates against coronaviruses. Here, we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from coronavirus-infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: adenosine-to-inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and cytosine-to-uracil changes from APOBEC deaminases. Mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of Coronaviridae from human hosts reveals mutational patterns consistent with those observed in the transcriptomic data. However, the reduced ADAR signature in these data raises the possibility that ADARs might be more effective than APOBECs in restricting viral propagation. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.},

DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the modification and the 3′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown transcripts and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

Publication bias in favor of positive findings influences the distribution of published results. We find that unless a sufficient fraction of negative results are published, false claims frequently can become canonized as fact. Data-dredging, p-hacking, and similar behaviors exacerbate the problem. Should negative results become easier to publish as a claim approaches acceptance as a fact, however, true and false claims would be more readily distinguished.

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

In acute studies, systemic administration of low dose oxytocin exerted a protective, preconditioning effect in experimental models of myocardial ischemia and infarction. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic administration of low dose oxytocin following angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and renal damage. Angiotensin II (40 μg/Kg/h) only, oxytocin only (20 or 100 ng/Kg/h), or angiotensin II combined with oxytocin (20 or 100 ng/Kg/h) were infused subcutaneously in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 28 days. At day 7, oxytocin or angiotensin-II only did not change hemodynamic parameters, but animals that received a combination of oxytocin and angiotensin-II had significantly elevated systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure compared to controls (P {\textless} 0.01). Hemodynamic changes were accompanied by significant left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy and renal damage at day 28 in animals treated with angiotensin II (P {\textless} 0.05) or both oxytocin and angiotensin II, compared to controls (P {\textless} 0.01). Prolonged oxytocin administration did not affect plasma concentrations of renin and atrial natriuretic peptide, but was associated with the activation of calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, a canonical signalling mechanism in pressure overload-induced cardiovascular disease. These data demonstrate that oxytocin accelerated angiotensin-II induced hypertension and end-organ renal damage, suggesting caution should be exercised in the chronic use of oxytocin in individuals with hypertension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94\% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2\% vs. 25.0\%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95\% CI, −17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8\%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.},

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, with an original indication to prevent or cure malaria, have been successfully used to treat several infectious (HIV, Q fever, Whipple’s disease, fungal infections), rheumatological (systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome), and other immunological diseases. Indeed, they have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, anti-infective, antithrombotic, and metabolic effects. Among the biological effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, it is important to highlight their antitumoral properties, likely due to their strong antiproliferative, antimutagenic, and inhibiting autophagy capacities. These effects make these drugs a possible option in the treatment of several tumors in association with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Finally, the repurposing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently being examined for neurological diseases such as neurosarcoidosis, chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to corticosteroids, and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Several ongoing clinical trials have been testing these drugs in non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseases. Moreover, the well-demonstrated good tolerability of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine make them safe even during pregnancy. Gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations are considered not to be serious, while retinal, neuromuscular, and cardiac toxicities are classified as serious adverse events.},

The direct myocardial infusion with OT into an ischemic or failing heart has the potential to elicit a variety of cardioprotective effects. OT treatment attenuates cardiomyocyte (CMs) death induced by ischemia-reperfusion by activating pro-survival pathways within injured CMs in vivo and in isolated cells. OT treatment reduces cardiac apoptosis, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. The OT/OT receptor (OTR) system is downregulated in the db/db mouse model of type 2 diabetes which develops genetic diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) similar to human disease. We have shown that chronic OT treatment prevents the development of DC in the db/db mouse. In addition, OT stimulates glucose uptake in both cardiac stem cells and CMs, and increases cell resistance to diabetic conditions. OT may help replace lost CMs by stimulating the in situ differentiation of cardiac stem cells into functional mature CMs. Lastly, adult stem cells amenable for transplantation such as MSCs could be preconditioned with OT ex vivo and implanted into the injured heart to aid in tissue regeneration through direct differentiation, secretion of protective and cardiomyogenic factors and/or their fusion with injured CMs.},

	abstract = {Pharmacological studies in humans and animals suggest the existence of vascular endothelial vasopressin (AVP)/oxytocin (OT) receptors that mediate a vasodilatory effect. However, the nature of the receptor subtype(s) involved in this vasodilatory response remains controversial, and its coupled intracellular pathways are unknown. Thus, we set out to determine the type and signaling pathways of the AVP/OT receptor(s) expressed in human vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Saturation binding experiments with purified membranes of primary cultures of ECs from human umbilical vein (HUVEC), aorta (HAEC), and pulmonary artery (HPAEC) and [3H]AVP or [3H]OT revealed the existence of specific binding sites with a greater affinity for OT than AVP (K(d) = 1.75 vs. 16.58 nM). Competition binding experiments in intact HUVECs (ECV304 cell line) with the AVP antagonist [125I]4-hydroxyphenacetyl-D- Tyr(Me)-Phe-Gln-Asn-Arg-Pro-Arg-NH2 or the OT antagonist [125I]D(CH2)5[O-Me-Tyr-Thr-Orn-Tyr-NH2]vasotocin, and various AVP/OT analogs confirmed the existence of a single class of surface receptors of the classical OT subtype. RT-PCR experiments with total RNA extracted from HUVEC, HAEC, and HPAEC and specific primers for the human V1 vascular, V2 renal, V3 pituitary, and OT receptors amplified the OT receptor sequence only. No new receptor subtype could be amplified when using degenerate primers. DNA sequencing of the coding region of the human EC OT receptor revealed a nucleotide sequence 100\% homologous to that of the uterine OT receptor reported previously. Stimulation of ECs by OT produced mobilization of intracellular calcium and the release of nitric oxide that was prevented by chelation of extra- and intracellular calcium. No stimulation of cAMP or PG production was noted. Finally, OT stimulation of ECs led to a calcium and protein kinase C-dependent cellular proliferation response. Thus, human vascular ECs express OT receptors that are structurally identical to the uterine and mammary OT receptors. These endothelial OT receptors produce a calcium-dependent vasodilatory response via stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway and have a trophic action.},

	doi = {10.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.629},
	abstract = {The neurohypophysial peptide oxytocin (OT) and OT-like hormones facilitate reproduction in all vertebrates at several levels. The major site of OT gene expression is the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. In response to a variety of stimuli such as suckling, parturition, or certain kinds of stress, the processed OT peptide is released from the posterior pituitary into the systemic circulation. Such stimuli also lead to an intranuclear release of OT. Moreover, oxytocinergic neurons display widespread projections throughout the central nervous system. However, OT is also synthesized in peripheral tissues, e.g., uterus, placenta, amnion, corpus luteum, testis, and heart. The OT receptor is a typical class I G protein-coupled receptor that is primarily coupled via Gq proteins to phospholipase C-β. The high-affinity receptor state requires both Mg2+ and cholesterol, which probably function as allosteric modulators. The agonist-binding region of the receptor has been characterized by mutagenesis and molecular modeling and is different from the antagonist binding site. The function and physiological regulation of the OT system is strongly steroid dependent. However, this is, unexpectedly, only partially reflected by the promoter sequences in the OT receptor gene. The classical actions of OT are stimulation of uterine smooth muscle contraction during labor and milk ejection during lactation. While the essential role of OT for the milk let-down reflex has been confirmed in OT-deficient mice, OT's role in parturition is obviously more complex. Before the onset of labor, uterine sensitivity to OT markedly increases concomitant with a strong upregulation of OT receptors in the myometrium and, to a lesser extent, in the decidua where OT stimulates the release of PGF2α. Experiments with transgenic mice suggest that OT acts as a luteotrophic hormone opposing the luteolytic action of PGF2α. Thus, to initiate labor, it might be essential to generate sufficient PGF2α to overcome the luteotrophic action of OT in late gestation. OT also plays an important role in many other reproduction-related functions, such as control of the estrous cycle length, follicle luteinization in the ovary, and ovarian steroidogenesis. In the male, OT is a potent stimulator of spontaneous erections in rats and is involved in ejaculation. OT receptors have also been identified in other tissues, including the kidney, heart, thymus, pancreas, and adipocytes. For example, in the rat, OT is a cardiovascular hormone acting in concert with atrial natriuretic peptide to induce natriuresis and kaliuresis. The central actions of OT range from the modulation of the neuroendocrine reflexes to the establishment of complex social and bonding behaviors related to the reproduction and care of the offspring. OT exerts potent antistress effects that may facilitate pair bonds. Overall, the regulation by gonadal and adrenal steroids is one of the most remarkable features of the OT system and is, unfortunately, the least understood. One has to conclude that the physiological regulation of the OT system will remain puzzling as long as the molecular mechanisms of genomic and nongenomic actions of steroids have not been clarified.},

Results: Two organic NO donor compounds, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), were tested in a broad range of concentrations. The non-nitrosylated form of SNAP, N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP), was included as a control compound in the assay. Antiviral activity was estimated by the inhibition of the SARS-CoV cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells, determined by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested in parallel. Conclusion: The survival rate of SARS-CoV infected cells was greatly increased by the treatment with SNAP, and the concentration of this compound needed to inhibit the viral cytopathic effect to 50\% was 222 μM, with a selectivity index of 3.

	abstract = {In conscious, chronically instrumented normotensive male Wistar rats intravenous (i.v.) administration of oxytocin (OXT) (≥ 100 ng) induced a dose-related biphasic change in mean arterial pressure (MAP). This consisted of an initial pressor effect accompanied by bradycardia and a decrease in cardiac output (CO), followed by a more prolonged fall in MAP which reached a maximum 30 min after injection and was accompanied by an increase in CO. The more specific (Thr4, Gly7]OXT analogue (0.01-10 μg i.v.) caused a dose-related fall in MAP and a rise in CO which reached a maximum after 15-30 min. Similarly in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the stroke prone strain (SHRSP) an initial pressor effect and delayed fall in MAP were apparent after OXT (0.1 and 10 μg i.v.) only the decrease in MAP being evident with the [Thr4, Gly7]OXT analogue. These responses were significantly larger than those observed in Wistar Kyoto controls. The pressor effects are therefore interpreted to be due to vasopressin receptor activation while the depressor effects appear to be oxytocin specific. In sinoaortic denervated rats, OXT (0.1 and 10 μg i.v.) induced an enhanced initial pressor effect with a much reduced reflex bradycardia and fall in CO. A larger and more prolonged delayed fall in MAP was apparent with both OXT and [Thr4, Gly7]OXT accompanied by a decrease in CO when compared to sham-operated controls. Intracisternally (i.c.) administered OXT (0.05-10 ng) had no effect on MAP or heart rate. However OXT and [Thr4, Gly7]OXT (10 ng i.c.) caused a decrease in baroreflex sensitivity in response to both a rise and a fall in MAP induced by phenylephrine (1 μg) and sodium nitroprusside (13 μg) respectively. It is concluded that OXT is involved in cardiovascular regulation, inducing a decrease in baroreflex sensitivity upon central administration and a fall in MAP when injected i.v. © 1985.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal inflammation, but the accurate etiology remains to be elucidated. Increasing evidence has shown that macrophages polarize to different phenotypes depending on the intestinal microenvironment and are associated with the progression of IBD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of oxytocin, a neuroendocrinal, and pro-health peptide, on the modulation of macrophages polarization and the progression of experimental colitis. Our data demonstrated that oxytocin decreased the sensitivity of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimulation with lower expression of inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, but increased the sensitivity to IL-4 stimulation with enhanced expression of M2-type genes, arginase I (Arg1), CD206, and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3). This bidirectional modulation was partly due to the up-regulation of β-arrestin2 and resulted in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling and reinforcement of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 phosphorylation. Moreover, oxytocin receptor (OXTR) myeloid deficiency mice were more susceptible to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) intervention compared with the wild mice. For the first time, we reveal that oxytocin–oxytocin receptor system participates in modulating the polarization of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype and alleviates experimental colitis. These findings provide new potential insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD.},

Recently, OXT expression was detected in keratinocytes, but expression of its receptor and function are still unexplored in human skin. Here, we showed that both OXT and its receptor are expressed in primary human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. OXT-induced dose-dependent calcium fluxes in both cell types demonstrating that the OXT receptor (OXTR) is functionally expressed. We also showed that OXT decreases proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. In order to further investigate OXT-mediated functions in skin cells, we performed OXTR knockdown experiments. OXTR knockdown in dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes led to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and reduced levels of glutathione (GSH). Moreover, OXTR-depleted keratinocytes exhibited an increased release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6, CCL5 and CXCL10. Our data indicate that the OXT system modulates key processes which are dysregulated in atopic dermatitis (AD) such as proliferation, inflammation and oxidative stress responses. Furthermore, we detected a downregulation of the OXT system in peri-lesional and lesional atopic skin. Taken together, these data suggest that the OXT system is a novel neuroendocrine mediator in human skin homoeostasis and clinically relevant to stressed skin conditions like AD. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.},

In vitro, oxytocin had no impact on LPS effects in releasing TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy human donors. In summary, oxytocin decreases the neuroendocrine and cytokine activation caused by bacterial endotoxin in men, possibly due to the pharmacological modulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.

In a simulated ball game where participants interacted with fictitious partners, we found that after oxytocin inhalation, patients exhibited stronger interactions with the most socially cooperative partner and reported enhanced feelings of trust and preference. Also, during free viewing of pictures of faces, oxytocin selectively increased patients' gazing time on the socially informative region of the face, namely the eyes. Thus, under oxytocin, patients respond more strongly to others and exhibit more appropriate social behavior and affect, suggesting a therapeutic potential of oxytocin through its action on a core dimension of autism.},

	abstract = {The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is one of the major targets of research in neuroscience, with respect to social functioning. Oxytocin promotes social skills and improves the quality of face processing in individuals with social dysfunctions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although one of OT's key functions is to promote social behavior during dynamic social interactions, the neural correlates of this function remain unknown. Here, we combined acute intranasal OT (IN-OT) administration (24 IU) and fMRI with an interactive ball game and a face-matching task in individuals with ASD (N = 20). We found that IN-OT selectively enhanced the brain activity of early visual areas in response to faces as compared to non-social stimuli. OT inhalation modulated the BOLD activity of amygdala and hippocampus in a context-dependent manner. Interestingly, IN-OT intake enhanced the activity of mid-orbitofrontal cortex in response to a fair partner, and insula region in response to an unfair partner. These OT-induced neural responses were accompanied by behavioral improvements in terms of allocating appropriate feelings of trust toward different partners' profiles. Our findings suggest that OT impacts the brain activity of key areas implicated in attention and emotion regulation in an adaptive manner, based on the value of social cues.},

	abstract = {The role of oxytocin in social cognition has attracted tremendous interest in social neuroscience and psychiatry. Some studies have reported improvement in social symptoms following oxytocin treatment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), while others point to endogenous factors influencing its efficiency and to mixed results in terms of long-term clinical benefits. Epigenetic modification to the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) in ASD could be an informative biomarker of treatment efficacy. Yet, little is known about the relationship between OXTR methylation, clinical severity, and brain function in ASD. Here, we investigated the relationship between OXTR methylation, ASD diagnosis (in N = 35 ASD and N = 64 neurotypical group), measures of social responsiveness, and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between areas involved in social cognition and reward processing (in a subset of ASD, N = 30). Adults with ASD showed higher OXTR methylation levels in the intron 1 area compared with neurotypical subjects. This hypermethylation was related to clinical symptoms and to a hypoconnectivity between cortico-cortical areas involved in theory of mind. Methylation at a CpG site in the exon 1 area was positively related to social responsiveness deficits in ASD and to a hyperconnectivity between striatal and cortical brain areas. Taken together, these findings provide initial evidence for OXTR hypermethylation in the intron area as a potential biomarker for adults with ASD with less severe developmental communication deficits, but with impairments in theory of mind and self-awareness. Also, OXTR methylation in the exon 1 area could be a potential biomarker of sociability sensitive to life experiences.},

	abstract = {A universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI) has been established, periodically updated, and refined over the past twenty years. The primary purpose of the UDMI is to bring uniformity and accuracy to clinical diagnosis. Herein, a review and analysis of the UDMI is presented with emphasis on clinicopathological correlation. Determination of the presence of myocardial injury is based on the detection of abnormal serum cardiac biomarkers, particularly cardiac troponin (cTn), and in the current fourth iteration of the UDMI, high sensitivity (hs)-cTn. Differentiation of myocardial infarction from other causes of myocardial injury requires the documentation of clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia. In this review, difficulties in applying the UDMI in actual practice are discussed, based on the experience and perspective of those of us who face these problems as part of our own practice of pathology. The complexity in application of the UDMI is highlighted by the presentation of five illustrative cases involving the differential diagnosis of myocardial injury and myocardial infarction due to atherothrombotic and nonatherothrombotic coronary artery disease. The cases include myocardial infarction due to severe coronary atherosclerosis, supply-demand mismatch, coronary artery dissection associated with an eosinophilic coronary periarteritis, and coronary thromboembolism, and a case with a differential diagnosis of myocarditis and myocardial infarction. These cases illustrate how pathological findings can contribute to more accurate application of the UDMI and how, when critically applied, the UDMI can be used to better characterize myocardial infarcts in clinical practice.},

The population pharmacokinetics of oxytocin was described using a 2-compartment disposition model with a flexible parallel absorption model accounting for double-peak profiles following vaginal administration. The clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, distribution half-life, and terminal half-life were estimated to be 27 L/h, 15 L, 5.5 minutes, and 1.2 hours, respectively. The bioavailability following vaginal administration was estimated to be 2.5\% for the typical patient, but with considerable variability both between individuals (interindividual variability of 374\%) and between occasions (interoccasion variability of 79\%). The data and the developed model add new and important information as to the clinical pharmacokinetics of oxytocin.},

The term was popularized largely in the context of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection, bringing the term into popular media. In this review, we focus on the cytokine storm in the context of virus infection, and we highlight how high-throughput genomic methods are revealing the importance of the kinetics of cytokine gene expression and the remarkable degree of redundancy and overlap in cytokine signaling. We also address evidence for and against the role of the cytokine storm in the pathology of clinical and infectious disease and discuss why it has been so difficult to use knowledge of the cytokine storm and immunomodulatory therapies to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with severe acute infections.},

Interestingly, a novel homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme, termed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV. Angiotensin-converting enzyme and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain and provide different key functions in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin-converting enzyme cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, which is a key effector peptide of the system and exerts multiple biological functions, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels. Importantly, our recent studies using ACE2 knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from ARDS. Furthermore, SARS-CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression. Notably, injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo, which can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway, suggesting that the activation of the pulmonary RAS influences the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and SARS. © 2008 The Authors.},

BP gradually returned to preexperimental levels within 10 days after the last injection in male rats but, in females, the significant lowering of BP remained unchanged during this period. Also OXY ICV (1 μg/kg) decreased BP (p {\textless} 0.05 after one day, p {\textless} 0.001 after 5 days of injections).

There are increasing evidences for the role of the neuropeptide oxytocin in modulating a wide range of social behaviors, in reducing anxiety, and in impacting the social brain network. Oxytocin also promotes social functions in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and reduces anxiety and fear in anxiety disorders. In this chapter, we will emphasize the importance of integrating basic research and clinical human research in determining optimal strategies for drug discoveries for social dysfunctions and anxiety disorders. We will highlight the significance of adopting a precision medicine approach to optimize targeted treatments with oxytocin in neuropsychiatry. Oxytocin effects on social behavior and brain function can vary from one individual to another based on external factors, such as heterogeneity in autism phenotype, childhood experiences, personality, attachment style, and oxytocin receptor polymorphisms. Hence, targeted therapies for subgroups of patients can help alleviating some of the core symptoms and lead to a better future for these patients and their families.},

	abstract = {Previous studies indicated that the central nervous system induces release of the cardiac hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) by release of oxytocin from the neurohypophysis. The presence of specific transcripts for the oxytocin receptor was demonstrated in all chambers of the heart by amplification of cDNA by the PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers. Oxytocin receptor mRNA content in the heart is 10 times lower than in the uterus of female rats. Oxytocin receptor transcripts were demonstrated by in situ hybridization in atrial and ventricular sections and confirmed by competitive binding assay using frozen heart sections. Perfusion of female rat hearts for 25 min with Krebs-Henseleit buffer resulted in nearly constant release of ANP. Addition of oxytocin (10-6 M) significantly stimulated ANP release, and an oxytocin receptor antagonist (10-7 and 10-6 M) caused dose-related inhibition of oxytocin-induced ANP release and in the last few minutes of perfusion decreased ANP release below that in control hearts, suggesting that intracardiac oxytocin stimulates ANP release. In contrast, brain natriuretic peptide release was unaltered by oxytocin. During perfusion, heart rate decreased gradually and it was further decreased significantly by oxytocin (10-6 M). This decrease was totally reversed by the oxytocin antagonist (10-6 M) indicating that oxytocin released ANP that directly slowed the heart, probably by release of cyclic GMP. The results indicate that oxytocin receptors mediate the action of oxytocin to release ANP, which slows the heart and reduces its force of contraction to produce a rapid reduction in circulating blood volume.},

As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1\% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5.

Methods: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0·6 (0·6-0·8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4·7 (3·6-5·8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0·8-1·4); 2·0 (1·5-2·9)]. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC=0·93) and neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) (AUC =0·94) were identified as powerful prognostic factors affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. Interpretation: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R and NLR may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.

Of the different classes of antimalarial drugs, only the quinolines, and structurally related antimalarial drugs, have clinically significant cardiovascular effects. Drugs in this class can exacerbate malaria-associated orthostatic hypotension and several have been shown to delay ventricular depolarisation slightly (class 1c effect), resulting in widening of the QRS complex, but only quinidine and halofantrine have clinically significant effects on ventricular repolarisation (class 3 effect). Both drugs cause potentially dangerous QT prolongation, and halofantrine has been associated with sudden death. The parenteral quinoline formulations (chloroquine, quinine, and quinidine) are predictably hypotensive when injected rapidly, and cardiovascular collapse can occur with self-poisoning. Transiently hypotensive plasma concentrations of chloroquine can occur when doses of 5 mg base/kg or more are given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. At currently recommended doses, other antimalarial drugs do not have clinically significant cardiac effects.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite limited and conflicting data on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of this drug when clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible. Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited observational evidence. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April 11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented. RESULTS: A total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8\%, 22.1\%, 11.4\%, respectively. Rates of ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3\%, 6.9\%, 14.1\%, respectively. Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95\% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the NEJM.

	abstract = {Study objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety profiles of corticosteroid therapy in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. Design: Four hundred one of 1,278 SARS cases treated in Guangzhou China between December 2002 and June 2003 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria issued by the World Health Organization for confirmed identification of SARS. Among them, the diagnosis of critical SARS was defined by criteria of SAMS guidelines incorporated with a low oxygenation index (OI) [{\textless} 300 mm Hg]. Data of these patients retrieved irom a database were retrospectively analyzed by logistic regression and Cox regression for the effect of corticosteroid therapy on death, hospitalizatton days, and complication presentation. Results: Among the 401 SARS patients studied, 147 of 249 noncritical patients (59.0\%) received corticosteroids (mean daily dose, 105.3 ± 86.1 mg) [± SD], and all survived the disease; 121 of 152 critical patients (79.6\%) received corticosteroids at a mean daily dose of 133.5 ± 102.3 mg, and 25 died. Analysis of these 401 confirmed cases did not show any benefits of corticosteroid on the death rate and hospitalization days. However, when focused on 152 critical SAMS cases, factors correlated with these end points indicated by univariate analysis included use of corticosteroid, age, rigor at onset, secondary respiratory infections, pulmonary rales, grading of OI, and use of invasive ventilation. After adjustment for possible confounders, treatment with corticosteroid was shown contributing to lower overall mortality, instant mortality, and shorter hospitalization stay (p {\textless} 0.05). Incidence of complications was significantly associated with the need for invasive ventilation but not with use of corticosteroids. Conclusion: This Guangzhou retrospective study revealed that proper use of corticosteroid in confirmed critical SARS resulted in lowered mortality and shorter hospitalization stay, and was not associated with significant secondary lower respiratory infection and other complications.},

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0196-9781(97)00209-X},
	abstract = {Our previous experiments suggested that natriuresis induced by blood volume expansion, was brought about by oxytocin (OT)-stimulated atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release from the right atrium. We hypothesized that the ANP released might exert effects on the atrium itself and therefore carried out in vitro experiments to test this hypothesis. Heart rate and isometric tension were recorded from isolated rat atria mounted in an organ bath. Oxytocin exerted a dose-related, negative chrono- and inotropic effect with a minimal effective concentration (MEC) of 3 μM, 10-fold higher than required for ANP to exert comparable effects. The effects of OT were not blocked by atropine suggesting that they were not mediated via release of acetylcholine. Eight-bromoguanosine 3'-5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) had similar effects to those of OT and ANP, suggesting that the effects of ANP were mediated by cGMP. When isolated ventricles, left or right atria, were incubated in vitro, OT had a dose-related effect to stimulate the release of ANP into the medium only from right atria with a MEC of 0.1 μM. A specific OT antagonist, F792 (1 μM), inhibited basal release of ANP and blocked the stimulatory action of OT on ANP release. The results support the hypothesis that OT, acting on its putative receptors in the right atrium, stimulates the release of ANP which then exerts a negative chrono- and inotropic effect via activation of guanylyl cyclase and release of cGMP. The ability of the oxytocin antagonist to reduce basal release of ANP from atria incubated in vitro supports the hypothesis that these effects could be physiologically significant. We hypothesize that blood volume expansion via baroreceptor input to the brain causes the release of OT which circulates to the heart and stimulates the release of ANP from the right atrium. This ANP then has a negative ino- and chronotropic effect in the atrium and possibly a negative inotropic effect in the right ventricle, left atrium and left ventricle, to produce an acute reduction in cardiac output that, coupled with its peripheral vasodilating actions, causes a rapid reduction in effective circulating blood volume. The ANP released would also act on the kidneys to cause natriuresis and ANP acts within the brain to inhibit water and salt intake leading to a gradual recovery of circulating blood volume to normal.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Cancer-directed immunotherapies are transforming the landscape in oncology as new and exciting therapies move from the laboratory to the bedside. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells are one of these novel therapies, demonstrating impressive efficacy against B-cell malignancies. With the development of new therapies, it is not uncommon to identify new and unanticipated toxicities. CAR-T cells cause unique toxicities not typically found with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy or small molecule inhibitors. Areas covered: CAR-T cell associated toxicities include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES), alternatively known as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Prompt identification and management of CRS and CRES are imperative for the prevention of life-threatening complications of these innovative therapies. This literature review describes the seminal trials of CD19-directed immunotherapy and the pathophysiology and management of the toxicities found with CAR-T cells. In addition, the use of the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab for CRS is reviewed. Expert opinion: This review describes the recommended management of CRS and CRES and examines the current limitations in management. Alternative therapies for the treatment of CAR-T cell related toxicities are also explored. Furthermore, the review proposes future directions for research.},

	abstract = {Background: With the increased availability of high throughput data, such as DNA microarray data, researchers are capable of producing large amounts of biological data. During the analysis of such data often there is the need to further explore the similarity of genes not only with respect to their expression, but also with respect to their functional annotation which can be obtained from Gene Ontology (GO). Results: We present the freely available software package GOSim, which allows to calculate the functional similarity of genes based on various information theoretic similarity concepts for GO terms. GOSim extends existing tools by providing additional lately developed functional similarity measures for genes. These can e.g. be used to cluster genes according to their biological function. Vice versa, they can also be used to evaluate the homogeneity of a given grouping of genes with respect to their GO annotation. GOSim hence provides the researcher with a flexible and powerful tool to combine knowledge stored in GO with experimental data. It can be seen as complementary to other tools that, for instance, search for significantly overrepresented GO terms within a given group of genes. Conclusion: GOSim is implemented as a package for the statistical computing environment R and is distributed under GPL within the CRAN project. © 2007 Fröhlich et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {European funding under Framework 7 (FP7) for the virtual physiological human (VPH) project has been in place now for 5 years. The VPH Network of Excellence (NoE) has been set up to help develop common standards, open source software, freely accessible data and model repositories, and various training and dissemination activities for the project. It is also working to coordinate the many clinically targeted projects that have been funded under the FP7 calls. An initial vision for the VPH was defined by the FP6 STEP project in 2006. In 2010, we wrote an assessment of the accomplishments of the first two years of the VPH in which we considered the biomedical science, healthcare and information and communications technology challenges facing the project (Hunter et al. 2010 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 368, 2595-2614 (doi:10.1098/rsta.2010.0048)). We proposed that a not-for-profit professional umbrella organization, the VPH Institute, should be established as a means of sustaining the VPH vision beyond the time-frame of the NoE. Here, we update and extend this assessment and in particular address the following issues raised in response to Hunter et al.: (i) a vision for the VPH updated in the light of progress made so far, (ii) biomedical science and healthcare challenges that the VPH initiative can address while also providing innovation opportunities for the European industry, and (iii) external changes needed in regulatory policy and business models to realize the full potential that the VPH has to offer to industry, clinics and society generally. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We sought to develop an in silico AP (isAP) model that provides an assessment of the effect of a compound on the myocyte AP duration (APD) using concentration-effect curve data from a panel of five ICs (hNav1.5, hCav1.2, hKv4.3/hKChIP2.2, hKv7.1/hminK, hKv11.1). A test set of 53 compounds was selected to cover a range of selective and mixed IC modulators that were tested for their effects on optically measured APD. A threshold of {\textgreater}10\% change in APD at 90\% repolarization (APD 90 ) was used to signify an effect at the top test concentration. To capture the variations observed in left ventricular midmyocardial myocyte APD data from 19 different dogs, the isAP model was calibrated to produce an ensemble of 19 model variants that could capture the shape and form of the APs and also quantitatively replicate dofetilide- and diltiazem-induced APD 90 changes. Provided with IC panel data only, the isAP model was then used, blinded, to predict APD 90 changes greater than 10\%. At a simulated concentration of 30 μM and based on a criterion that six of the variants had to agree, isAP prediction was scored as showing greater than 80\% predictivity of compound activity. Thus, early in drug discovery, the isAP model allows integrating separate IC data and is amenable to the throughput required for use as a virtual screen.},

Most molecular tests have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) and are Conformité Européenne (CE) marked. A wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed that complement the molecular assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

When to test? Whom to test? What to test? How often to test? And, what to do with test results? Since SARS–CoV-2 is a new virus, there is little evidence to fall back on for test utilization and diagnostic stewardship (1). Several points need to be considered to begin answering of these questions; specifically, what types of tests are available and under which circumstances are they useful? This understanding can help guide the use of testing at the local, regional, state, and national levels and inform those assessing the supply chain to ensure that needed testing is and continues to be available. Here, we explain the types of tests available and how they might be useful in the face of a rapidly changing and never-before-experienced situation. There are two broad categories of SARS–CoV-2 tests: those that detect the virus itself and those that detect the host’s response to the virus. Each will be considered separately. We must recognize that we are dealing with (i) a new virus, (ii) an unprecedented pandemic in modern times, and (iii) uncharted territory. With this in mind, in the absence of either proven effective therapy or a vaccine, diagnostic testing, which we have, becomes an especially important tool, informing patient management and potentially helping to save lives by limiting the spread …},

	abstract = {An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.},

	abstract = {Autophagy is an essential cellular process affecting virus infections and other diseases and Beclin1 (BECN1) is one of its key regulators. Here, we identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a hetero-complex involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhance autophagy but also reduce the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link constitutes a promising target for host-directed antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagy-sensitive conditions.},

	abstract = {Objective The diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in routine practice is largely a clinical one and requires a high index of suspicion by the treating physician. This great dependence on clinical judgment frequently leads to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Tear protein profiles have been proposed as simple and reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of SS. Given that cathepsin S activity is increased in the lacrimal glands and tears of NOD mice (a murine model of SS), the aim of this study was to explore the clinical utility of using tear cathepsin S (CTSS) activity as a biomarker for SS. Methods A method to measure CTSS activity in tears eluted from Schirmer's test strips was developed and validated. Schirmer's tests were performed and CTSS activity measurements were obtained in 278 female subjects, including 73 with SS, 79 with rheumatoid arthritis, 40 with systemic lupus erythematosus, 10 with blepharitis, 31 with nonspecific dry eye disease, and 12 with other autoimmune diseases, as well as 33 healthy control subjects. Results The median tear CTSS activity in patients with SS was 4.1-fold higher than that in patients with other autoimmune diseases, 2.1-fold higher than that in patients with nonspecific dry eye disease, and 41.1-fold higher than that in healthy control subjects. Tear CTSS levels were equally elevated in patients with primary SS and those with secondary SS, independent of the Schirmer's test strip values or the levels of circulating anti-SSA or anti-SSB antibodies. Conclusion Markedly high levels of tear CTSS activity are suggestive of SS. CTSS activity in tears can be measured in a simple, quick, economical, and noninvasive manner and may serve as a novel biomarker for autoimmune dacryoadenitis during the diagnostic evaluation for SS.

	abstract = {Objective To establish an easy and practical assay for identifying systemic interferon (IFN) type I bioactivity in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome ( pSS). The IFN type I signature is present in over half of the pSS patients and identifies a subgroup with a higher disease activity. This signature is currently assessed via laborious expression profiles of multiple IFN type I-inducible genes. Methods: In a cohort of 35 pSS patients, myxovirusresistance protein A (MxA) was assessed as a potential biomarker for type I IFN activity, using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on whole-blood and flow cytometric analyses (fluorescence-activated cell sorting, FACS) of isolated CD14 monocytes. In addition, potential biomarkers such as CD64, CD169 and B cell-activating factor (BAFF) were simultaneously analysed in CD14 monocytes using FACS. The IFNscore, a measure for total type I IFN bioactivity, was calculated using expression values of the IFN type I signature genes- IFI44, IFI44L, IFIT3, LY6E and MX1-in CD14 monocytes, determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: IFNscores correlated the strongest with monocyte MxA protein (r=0.741, p{\textless}001) and wholeblood MxA levels (r=0.764, p{\textless}0.001), weaker with CD169 (r=0.495, p{\textless}0.001) and CD64 (r=0.436, p=0.007), and not at all with BAFF protein. In particular, whole blood MxA levels correlated with EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index scores and numerous clinical pSS parameters. Interestingly, patients on hydroxychloroquine showed reduced MxA levels (EIA, p=0.04; FACS p=0.001). Conclusions: The MxA assays were excellent tools to assess IFN type I activity in pSS, MxA-EIA being the most practical. MxA levels associate with features of active disease and are reduced in hydroxychloroquinetreated patients, suggesting the clinical applicability of MxA in stratifying patients according to IFN positivity.},

	abstract = {Objective: Patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) are at greater risk of developing lymphoma. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) might be associated with lymphoma in primary SS. Methods: Serum levels of Flt-3L were measured in 369 patients with primary SS from the French Assessment of Systemic Signs and Evolution of Sjögren's Syndrome study cohort and in 10 patients with primary SS at the time of lymphoma diagnosis in an Italian cohort. Associations between increased levels of Flt-3L and a history of lymphoma, history of previously diagnosed criteria related to a high risk of lymphoma, and greater extent of disease activity were evaluated. Results: Among patients with primary SS, higher levels of Flt-3L were significantly associated with a history of lymphoma (P = 0.0001). Previous markers for risk of lymphoma development, such as presence of purpura, low levels of C4, presence of lymphocytopenia, low levels of IgM, high levels of β2-microglobulin, and a higher primary SS disease activity score, were all associated with higher levels of Flt-3L. The levels of Flt-3L were also increased in serum obtained from patients with primary SS at the time of lymphoma diagnosis. Furthermore, the Flt-3L levels were elevated in the serum of 6 patients up to 94 months (mean 46 months) prior to the diagnosis of lymphoma. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that an Flt-3L level of 175 pg/ml was the ideal cutoff value for demonstrating an association with lymphoma (specificity 97.5\%, sensitivity 44\%, negative predictive value 97\%). Conclusion: Flt-3L is associated with lymphoma in primary SS, and constitutes a good biologic marker. Higher levels of this cytokine are present several years before the diagnosis of lymphoma, and may be useful as a predictive marker of lymphoproliferative disorders in primary SS.

	abstract = {SS is an autoimmune disease. pSS affects exocrine glands predominantly, whereas sSS occurs with other autoimmune connective tissue disorders. Currently, care for patients with SS is palliative, as no established therapeutics target the disease directly, and its patho-genetic mechanisms remain uncertain. B-cell abnormalities have been identified in SS. CXCL13 directs B-cell chemotaxis and is elevated in several autoimmune diseases. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CXCL13 is elevated in SS in mice and humans and that neutralization of the chemokine ameliorates disease in a murine model. We assayed CXCL13 in mouse models and human subjects with SS to determine whether CXCL13 is elevated both locally and systemically during SS progression and whether CXCL13 may play a role in and be a biomarker for the disease. Cxcl13 expression in salivary tissue increases with disease progression, and its blockade resulted in a modest reduction in glandular inflammation in an SS model. We demonstrate that in humans CXCL13 is elevated in serum and saliva, and an elevated salivary CXCL13 level distinguishes patients with xerostomia. These data suggest a role for CXCL13 as a valuable biomarker in SS, as 74\% of patients with SS displayed elevated CXCL13 in sera, saliva, or both. Thus, CXCL13 may be pathogenically involved in SS and may serve as a new marker and a potential therapeutic target. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.},

	abstract = {Background: Profilins are ubiquitous proteins widely distributed in animals, including humans. They regulate actin polymerization by sequestering actin monomers in association with other actin-related proteins (Arps). Actin remodelling is essential for oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryo development; yet the role of profilins in these events is not well understood. Here we investigate profilin distribution and function during bovine fertilization and early embryogenesis, and we examine profilin localization with respect to the co-distribution of other Arps. Methods and results: Western blotting, confocal microscopy with immunofluorescence and protein inhibition studies with antibodies were implemented. Profilin distributes inside interphase nuclei, throughout the cytoplasm and near the cell cortex at different stages of bovine oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryo development. Expression is detected through the blastocyst stage, where profilin localizes to the inner cell mass as well as trophectoderm. Profilin co-distributes with actin monomers and Arps vasodilator-stimulated phospho protein, p140mDia, Arp 3 and p80 coilin in pronucleate-stage zygotes. Antiprofilin antibodies inhibit normal embryo development by disrupting microfilaments, but not microtubules, and result in a higher concentration of profilin and p140mDia mislocalized to the cortex. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that profilin regulates actin dynamics both within the cytoplasm and inside the nuclei of developing mammalian embryos and that its function is essential during fertilization to ensure successful development. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

Thirty-one SS patients and 57 control subjects were enrolled to this study. Their details were 23 cases with primary SS, 8 with secondary SS, 14 with dry eyes, 22 with miscellaneous ocular diseases, and 21 of healthy volunteers. Protein profiling in tear fluids was identified by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). Multiple protein changes were reproducibly detected in the primary SS group, including 10 potential novel biomarkers. Seven of the biomarkers (2094, 2743, 14191, 14702, 16429, 17453, 17792 m/z) were down-regulated and 3 biomarkers (3483, 4972, 10860 m/z) were up-regulated in primary SS group, comparing to the protein profiles of control subjects. When cutoff value of SS down-score was set less than 0.5, this result yielded 87\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. The positive predictive value for this sample set was 100\%.

The aim of this study was to recapitulate the diagnosis of SS through noninvasive means and to define the biologic state of SS patients' salivary glands. Methods Using a 187-plex capture antibody-based assay, salivary proteomic biomarker profiles were generated from patients with primary SS, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and asymptomatic controls. Discriminant function analyses and Gene Ontology-based network analyses allowed data analyses with a reductionist approach and with a focus on systems biology. Results Characterized by significant changes in 61 and 55 proteins, respectively, the salivary proteome of SS patients appeared profoundly altered compared to that of individuals without SS. On this basis, 4-plex and 6-plex biomarker signatures, both including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and clusterin, achieved accurate prediction of an individual's group membership for at least 94\% of cases. Of note, all misclassified SS patients presented with ectopic germinal center-like structures. Systematic inference of biologic meaning identified SS-related protein patterns delineating B cell-dominated immune responses, macrophage differentiation, and signs of T cell chemotaxis. In addition, proteomic Multi-Analyte Profiles provided insight about proteins related to collagen, cytokine, and growth factor synthesis as well as lipid transport. Conclusion The SS-related molecular landscape conveyed by saliva showed great congruence with histopathologic features found in SS and advances understanding of this disease at a molecular level.

	abstract = {Objective: SS is an autoimmune exocrinopathy affecting {\textasciitilde}1 million patients in the USA that is diagnosed mostly in middle-aged women. Oral fluids (OFs) serving as the mirror of the body were suggested as an ideal non-invasive diagnostic tool. Previously we developed depletion techniques for OF high-abundance proteins to increase visualization of low-abundance proteins. Therefore the aim of this study was to examine the effect of depletion pretreatments on the identification potential of SS OF biomarker candidates. Methods: Unstimulated OFs were collected from 18 female SS patients and 18 healthy age- and gendermatched controls. High-abundance proteins were depleted using affinity and immunodepletion methodologies followed by semi-quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and quantitative dimethylation liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To initially validate the MS results, western blotting was performed. Results: The use of depletion strategy before proteomics analysis increased identification ability by 3-fold. Overall, 79 biomarker candidates were identified. Proteins with the most pronounced fold changes were related to SS serum or tissue factors. In addition, bioinformatics analysis of proteins with a {\textgreater}3-fold increase in SS patients showed calcium-binding proteins, defence-response proteins, proteins involved in apoptotic regulation, stress-response proteins and cell motion{\textasciitilde}related proteins. Preliminary validation by western blotting of profilin and CA-I indicated similar expression profile trends to those identified by quantitative MS. Conclusion: The significance of OF novel depletion methodologies is clearly demonstrated for increased visibility of biomarker candidates as well as for unveiling possible mechanisms involved in this syndrome. This represents a major contribution to our ability to use OF as a future diagnostic fluid.},

Incorporation of additional diagnostics involving screening for disease-specific biomarkers in biological fluid is a promising concept that requires further investigation. In the current study we aimed to explore novel disease biomarkers in saliva and tears from pSS patients. Methods: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed on stimulated whole saliva and tears from 27 pSS patients and 32 healthy controls, and salivary and tear proteomic biomarker profiles were generated. LC-MS was also combined with size exclusion chromatography to isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs) from both fluids. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was conducted on joint fractions from the saliva and tears to determine size distribution and concentration of EVs. Further EV characterisation was performed by immunoaffinity capture of CD9-positive EVs using magnetic beads, detected by flow cytometry. The LC-MS data were analysed for quantitative differences between patient and control groups using Scaffold, and the proteins were further analysed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), for gene ontology overrepresentation, and the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins for protein-protein interaction network analysis. Results: Upregulation of proteins involved in innate immunity (LCN2), cell signalling (CALM) and wound repair (GRN and CALML5) were detected in saliva in pSS. Saliva EVs also displayed biomarkers critical for activation of the innate immune system (SIRPA and LSP1) and adipocyte differentiation (APMAP). Tear analysis indicated overexpression of proteins involved in TNF-α signalling (CPNE1) and B cell survival (PRDX3). Moreover, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was upregulated in saliva and tears in pSS. Consistently, DAVID analysis demonstrated pathways of the adaptive immune response in saliva, of cellular component assembly for saliva EVs, and of metabolism and protein folding in tears in pSS patients. Conclusions: LC-MS of saliva and tears from pSS patients, solely and in combination with size-exclusion chromatography allowed screening for possible novel biomarkers encompassing both salivary and lacrimal disease target organs. This approach could provide additional diagnostic accuracy in pSS, and could possibly also be applied for staging and monitoring the disease.},

	abstract = {Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited disorders affecting 1 in 3000-7000 people and characterized by abnormalities of the photoreceptors (rods and cones) or the retinal pigment epithelium of the retina which lead to progressive visual loss. RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked manner. While usually limited to the eye, RP may also occur as part of a syndrome as in the Usher syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Over 40 genes have been associated with RP so far, with the majority of them expressed in either the photoreceptors or the retinal pigment epithelium. The tremendous heterogeneity of the disease makes the genetics of RP complicated, thus rendering genotype-phenotype correlations not fully applicable yet. In addition to the multiplicity of mutations, in fact, different mutations in the same gene may cause different diseases. We will here review which genes are involved in the genesis of RP and how mutations can lead to retinal degeneration. In the future, a more thorough analysis of genetic and clinical data together with a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation might allow to reveal important information with respect to the likelihood of disease development and choices of therapy.},

	abstract = {Although many studies have been conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans, few studies have been conducted to identify alternative forms of natural genetic variation, such as insertion and deletion (INDEL) polymorphisms. In this report, we describe an initial map of human INDEL variation that contains 415,436 unique INDEL polymorphisms. These INDELs were identified with a computational approach using DNA re-sequencing traces that originally were generated for SNP discovery projects. They range from 1 bp to 9989 bp in length and are split almost equally between insertions and deletions, relative to the chimpanzee genome sequence. Five major classes of INDELs were identified, including (1) insertions and deletions of single-base pairs, (2) monomeric base pair expansions, (3) multi-base pair expansions of 2-15 bp repeat units, (4) transposon insertions, and (5) INDELs containing random DNA sequences. Our INDELs are distributed throughout the human genome with an average density of one INDEL per 7.2 kb of DNA. Variation hotspots were identified with up to 48-fold regional increases in INDEL and/or SNP variation compared with the chromosomal averages for the same chromosomes. Over 148,000 INDELs (35.7\%) were identified within known genes, and 5542 of these INDELs were located in the promoters and exons of genes, where gene function would be expected to be influenced the greatest. All INDELs in this study have been deposited into dbSNP and have been integrated into maps of human genetic variation that are available to the research community. ©2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashingbased software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time. Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both. Availability: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net.

	abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10-20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. © 2009 The Author(s).},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btw228},
	abstract = {Motivation: Drug repositioning, which aims to identify new indications for existing drugs, offers a promising alternative to reduce the total time and cost of traditional drug development. Many computational strategies for drug repositioning have been proposed, which are based on similarities among drugs and diseases. Current studies typically use either only drug-related properties (e.g. chemical structures) or only disease-related properties (e.g. phenotypes) to calculate drug or disease similarity, respectively, while not taking into account the influence of known drug-disease association information on the similarity measures. Results: In this article, based on the assumption that similar drugs are normally associated with similar diseases and vice versa, we propose a novel computational method named MBiRW, which utilizes some comprehensive similarity measures and Bi-Random walk (BiRW) algorithm to identify potential novel indications for a given drug. By integrating drug or disease features information with known drug-disease associations, the comprehensive similarity measures are firstly developed to calculate similarity for drugs and diseases. Then drug similarity network and disease similarity network are constructed, and they are incorporated into a heterogeneous network with known drug-disease interactions. Based on the drug-disease heterogeneous network, BiRW algorithm is adopted to predict novel potential drug-disease associations. Computational experiment results from various datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach has reliable prediction performance and outperforms several recent computational drug repositioning approaches. Moreover, case studies of five selected drugs further confirm the superior performance of our method to discover potential indications for drugs practically.

	abstract = {Existing computational methods for drug repositioning either rely only on the gene expression response of cell lines after treatment, or on drug-to-disease relationships, merging several information levels. However, the noisy nature of the gene expression and the scarcity of genomic data for many diseases are important limitations to such approaches. Here we focused on a drug-centered approach by predicting the therapeutic class of FDA-approved compounds, not considering data concerning the diseases. We propose a novel computational approach to predict drug repositioning based on state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. We have integrated multiple layers of information: i) on the distances of the drugs based on how similar are their chemical structures, ii) on how close are their targets within the protein-protein interaction network, and iii) on how correlated are the gene expression patterns after treatment. Our classifier reaches high accuracy levels (78\%), allowing us to re-interpret the top misclassifications as re-classifications, after rigorous statistical evaluation. Efficient drug repurposing has the potential to significantly impact the whole field of drug development.

Inspired by their success, here we present an in silico method for building a causal network (CauseNet) between drugs and diseases, in an attempt to systematically identify new therapeutic uses of existing drugs.Methods: Unlike the traditional 'one drug-one target-one disease' causal model, we simultaneously consider all possible causal chains connecting drugs to diseases via target- and gene-involved pathways based on rich information in several expert-curated knowledge-bases. With statistical learning, our method estimates transition likelihood of each causal chain in the network based on known drug-disease treatment associations (e.g. bexarotene treats skin cancer).Results: To demonstrate its validity, our method showed high performance (AUC = 0.859) in cross validation. Moreover, our top scored prediction results are highly enriched in literature and clinical trials. As a showcase of its utility, we show several drugs for potential re-use in Crohn's Disease.Conclusions: We successfully developed a computational method for discovering new uses of existing drugs based on casual inference in a layered drug-target-pathway-gene- disease network.

	abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets. © 2014 Nitish Srivastava, Geoffrey Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Ruslan Salakhutdinov.},

	abstract = {TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google.

	abstract = {A key goal of precision medicine is predicting the best drug therapy for a specific patient from genomic information. In oncology, cancers that appear similar pathologically can vary greatly in how they respond to the same drug. Fortunately, data from high-throughput screening programs often reveal important relationships between genomic variability of cancer cells and their response to drugs. Nevertheless, many current computational methods to predict compound activity against cancer cells require large quantities of genomic, epigenomic, and additional cellular data to develop and to apply. Here we integrate recent screening data and machine learning to train classification models that predict the activity/inactivity of compounds against cancer cells based on the mutational status of only 145 oncogenes and a set of compound structural descriptors. Using IC50 values of 1 μM as activity cutoffs, our predictive models have sensitivities of 87\%, specificities of 87\%, and yield an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal to 0.94. We also develop regression models to predict log(IC50) values of compounds for cancer cells; the models achieve a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 for cross-validation and up to 0.65-0.73 against blind test sets. Predictive performance remains strong when as few as 50 oncogenes are included. Finally, even when 40\% of experimental IC50 values are missing from screening data, they can be imputed with sufficient reliability that classification accuracy is not diminished. The presented models are fast to generate and may serve as easily implemented screening tools for personalized oncology medicine, drug repurposing, and drug discovery.},

We present a machine learning (ML) workflow to drug discovery or repositioning by predicting indication for a particular disease based on drug expression profiles, with a focus on applications in psychiatry. Drugs that are not originally indicated for the disease but with high predicted probabilities serve as candidates for repurposing. This approach is widely applicable to any chemicals or drugs with expression profiles measured, even if drug targets are unknown. It is also highly flexible as virtually any supervised learning algorithms can be used. We employed the ML approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia as well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various state-of-the-art ML approaches, including deep neural networks (DNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), elastic net regression, random forest, and gradient boosted trees. The predictive performance of the five approaches in cross validation did not differ substantially, with SVM slightly outperforming the others. However, other methods also reveal literature-supported repositioning candidates of different mechanisms of actions. As a further validation, we showed that the repositioning hits are enriched for psychiatric medications considered in clinical trials. We also examined the correlation between predicted probabilities of treatment potential and the number of related research articles, and found significant correlations for all methods, especially DNN. Finally, we propose that ML may provide a new avenue to exploring drug mechanisms via examining the variable importance of gene features.},

Many different in silico approaches for the identification of new drug-target interactions have been proposed, many of them based on a particular class of machine learning algorithms called kernel methods. These pattern classification algorithms are able to incorporate previous knowledge in the form of similarity functions, i.e., a kernel, and they have been successful in a wide range of supervised learning problems. The selection of the right kernel function and its respective parameters can have a large influence on the performance of the classifier. Recently, multiple kernel learning algorithms have been introduced to address this problem, enabling one to combine multiple kernels into large drug-target interaction spaces in order to integrate multiple sources of biological information simultaneously. The Kronecker regularized least squares with multiple kernel learning (KronRLS-MKL) is a machine learning algorithm that aims at integrating heterogeneous information sources into a single chemogenomic space to predict new drug-target interactions. This chapter describes how to obtain data from heterogeneous sources and how to implement and use KronRLS-MKL to predict new interactions.},

Conventional similarity- or docking-based computational methods for predicting CPIs rarely exploit latent features from currently available large-scale unlabeled compound and protein data and often limit their usage to relatively small-scale datasets. In the present study, we proposed DeepCPI, a novel general and scalable computational framework that combines effective feature embedding (a technique of representation learning) with powerful deep learning methods to accurately predict CPIs at a large scale. DeepCPI automatically learns the implicit yet expressive low-dimensional features of compounds and proteins from a massive amount of unlabeled data. Evaluations of the measured CPIs in large-scale databases, such as ChEMBL and BindingDB, as well as of the known drug-target interactions from DrugBank, demonstrated the superior predictive performance of DeepCPI. Furthermore, several interactions among small-molecule compounds and three G protein-coupled receptor targets (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, glucagon receptor, and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor) predicted using DeepCPI were experimentally validated. The present study suggests that DeepCPI is a useful and powerful tool for drug discovery and repositioning. The source code of DeepCPI can be downloaded from https://github.com/FangpingWan/DeepCPI.},

Artificial intelligence (AI), with an emphasis on deep learning, holds great promise in this area and is already being successfully applied to basic research, diagnosis, drug discovery, and clinical trials. Rare diseases (RDs), which are severely underrepresented in basic and clinical research, can particularly benefit from AI technologies. Of the more than 7000 RDs described worldwide, only 5\% have a treatment. The ability of AI technologies to integrate and analyze data from different sources (e.g., multi-omics, patient registries, and so on) can be used to overcome RDs’ challenges (e.g., low diagnostic rates, reduced number of patients, geographical dispersion, and so on). Ultimately, RDs’ AI-mediated knowledge could significantly boost therapy development. Presently, there are AI approaches being used in RDs and this review aims to collect and summarize these advances.

Owing to the complexity of the disease, its root cause still remains unclear. The existing anti-Alzheimer's drugs are unable to cure the disease while the current therapeutic options have provided only limited help in restoring moderate memory and remain ineffective at restricting the disease's progression. The striatalenriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) has been shown to be involved in the internalization of the receptor, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDR) and thus is associated with the disease. The present study was performed using machine learning algorithms, docking protocol and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop STEP inhibitors, which could be novel anti-Alzheimer's molecules. Methods The present study deals with the generation of computational predictive models based on chemical descriptors of compounds using machine learning approaches followed by substructure fragment analysis. To perform this analysis, the 2D molecular descriptors were generated and machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Sequential Minimization Optimization) were utilized. The binding mechanisms and the molecular interactions between the predicted active compounds and the target protein were modelled using docking methods. Further, the stability of the protein-ligand complex was evaluated using MD simulation studies. The substructure fragment analysis was performed using Substructure fingerprint (SubFp), which was further explored using a predefined dictionary. Results The present study demonstrates that the computational methodology used can be employed to examine the biological activities of small molecules and prioritize them for experimental screening. Large unscreened chemical libraries can be screened to identify potential novel hits and accelerate the drug discovery process. Additionally, the chemical libraries can be searched for significant substructure patterns as reported in the present study, thus possibly contributing to the activity of these molecules.},

However, a comprehensive drug-SE association knowledge base does not exist. In this study, we present a novel knowledge-driven (KD) approach to effectively extract a large number of drug-SE pairs from published biomedical literature. DATA AND METHODS For the text corpus, we used 21,354,075 MEDLINE records (119,085,682 sentences). First, we used known drug-SE associations derived from FDA drug labels as prior knowledge to automatically find SE-related sentences and abstracts. We then extracted a total of 49,575 drug-SE pairs from MEDLINE sentences and 180,454 pairs from abstracts. RESULTS On average, the KD approach has achieved a precision of 0.335, a recall of 0.509, and an F1 of 0.392, which is significantly better than a SVM-based machine learning approach (precision: 0.135, recall: 0.900, F1: 0.233) with a 73.0\% increase in F1 score. Through integrative analysis, we demonstrate that the higher-level phenotypic drug-SE relationships reflects lower-level genetic, genomic, and chemical drug mechanisms. In addition, we show that the extracted drug-SE pairs can be directly used in drug repositioning. CONCLUSION In summary, we automatically constructed a large-scale higher-level drug phenotype relationship knowledge, which can have great potential in computational drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Targeted anticancer drugs such as imatinib, trastuzumab and erlotinib dramatically improved treatment outcomes in cancer patients, however, these innovative agents are often associated with unexpected side effects. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these side effects are not well understood. The availability of a comprehensive knowledge base of side effects associated with targeted anticancer drugs has the potential to illuminate complex pathways underlying toxicities induced by these innovative drugs. While side effect association knowledge for targeted drugs exists in multiple heterogeneous data sources, published full-text oncological articles represent an important source of pivotal, investigational, and even failed trials in a variety of patient populations. In this study, we present an automatic process to extract targeted anticancer drug-associated side effects (drug-SE pairs) from a large number of high profile full-text oncological articles.We downloaded 13,855 full-text articles from the Journal of Oncology (JCO) published between 1983 and 2013. We developed text classification, relationship extraction, signaling filtering, and signal prioritization algorithms to extract drug-SE pairs from downloaded articles. We extracted a total of 26,264 drug-SE pairs with an average precision of 0.405, a recall of 0.899, and an F1 score of 0.465. We show that side effect knowledge from JCO articles is largely complementary to that from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels. Through integrative correlation analysis, we show that targeted drug-associated side effects positively correlate with their gene targets and disease indications. In conclusion, this unique database that we built from a large number of high-profile oncological articles could facilitate the development of computational models to understand toxic effects associated with targeted anticancer drugs.},

	abstract = {The search for small molecule inhibitors of Ebola virus (EBOV) has led to several high throughput screens over the past 3 years. These have identified a range of FDA-approved active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with anti-EBOV activity in vitro and several of which are also active in a mouse infection model. There are millions of additional commercially-available molecules that could be screened for potential activities as anti-EBOV compounds. One way to prioritize compounds for testing is to generate computational models based on the high throughput screening data and then virtually screen compound libraries. In the current study, we have generated Bayesian machine learning models with viral pseudotype entry assay and the EBOV replication assay data. We have validated the models internally and externally. We have also used these models to computationally score the MicroSource library of drugs to select those likely to be potential inhibitors. Three of the highest scoring molecules that were not in the model training sets, quinacrine, pyronaridine and tilorone, were tested in vitro and had EC 50 values of 350, 420 and 230 nM, respectively. Pyronaridine is a component of a combination therapy for malaria that was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency, which may make it more readily accessible for clinical testing. Like other known antimalarial drugs active against EBOV, it shares the 4-aminoquinoline scaffold. Tilorone, is an investigational antiviral agent that has shown a broad array of biological activities including cell growth inhibition in cancer cells, antifibrotic properties, α7 nicotinic receptor agonist activity, radioprotective activity and activation of hypoxia inducible factor-1. Quinacrine is an antimalarial but also has use as an anthelmintic. Our results suggest data sets with less than 1,000 molecules can produce validated machine learning models that can in turn be utilized to identify novel EBOV inhibitors in vitro.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Finding potential drug targets is a crucial step in drug discovery and development. Recently, resources such as the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 database provide gene expression profiles induced by various chemical and genetic perturbations and thereby make it possible to analyze the relationship between compounds and gene targets at a genome-wide scale. Current approaches for comparing the expression profiles are based on pairwise connectivity mapping analysis. However, this method makes the simple assumption that the effect of a drug treatment is similar to knocking down its single target gene. Since many compounds can bind multiple targets, the pairwise mapping ignores the combined effects of multiple targets, and therefore fails to detect many potential targets of the compounds. RESULTS We propose an algorithm to find sets of gene knock-downs that induce gene expression changes similar to a drug treatment. Assuming that the effects of gene knock-downs are additive, we propose a novel bipartite block-wise sparse multi-task learning model with super-graph structure (BBSS-MTL) for multi-target drug repositioning that overcomes the restrictive assumptions of connectivity mapping analysis. CONCLUSIONS The proposed method BBSS-MTL is more accurate for predicting potential drug targets than the simple pairwise connectivity mapping analysis on five datasets generated from different cancer cell lines.

However, rational design of drug mixtures poses formidable challenges because of the lack of or limited information about in vivo cell regulation, mechanisms of genetic pathway activation, and in vivo pathway interactions. Hence, most of the successfully repositioned drugs are the result of "serendipity", discovered during late phase clinical studies of unexpected but beneficial findings. The connections between drug candidates and their potential adverse drug reactions or new applications are often difficult to foresee because the underlying mechanism associating them is largely unknown, complex, or dispersed and buried in silos of information. Discovery of such multi-domain pharmacomodules-pharmacologically relevant sub-networks of biomolecules and/or pathways-from collection of databases by independent/simultaneous mining of multiple datasets is an active area of research.

The availability of big omics data offers opportunities to transform drug discovery process into a new paradigm of systems pharmacology that focuses on designing drugs to target molecular interaction networks instead of a single gene. Here, we develop a reliable multi-rank, multi-layered recommender system, ANTENNA, to mine large-scale chemical genomics and disease association data for prediction of novel drug-gene-disease associations. ANTENNA integrates a novel tri-factorization based dual-regularized weighted and imputed One Class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF) algorithm, tREMAP, with a statistical framework based on Random Walk with Restart and assess the reliability of specific predictions. In the benchmark, tREMAP clearly outperforms the single-rank OCCF. We apply ANTENNA to a real-world problem: repurposing old drugs for new clinical indications without effective treatments. We discover that FDA-approved drug diazoxide can inhibit multiple kinase genes responsible for many diseases including cancer and kill triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells efficiently [Formula: see text].

We propose to use Macau, a Bayesian multitask multi-relational algorithm to generalize from individual drugs and genes and explore the interactions between the drug targets and signaling pathways' activation. A typical insight would be: "Activation of pathway Y will confer sensitivity to any drug targeting protein X". We applied our methodology to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) screening, using gene expression of 990 cancer cell lines, activity scores of 11 signaling pathways derived from the tool PROGENy as cell line input and 228 nominal targets for 265 drugs as drug input. These interactions can guide a tissue-specific combination treatment strategy, for example suggesting to modulate a certain pathway to maximize the drug response for a given tissue. We confirmed in literature drug combination strategies derived from our result for brain, skin and stomach tissues.

The review focuses on the algorithmic design and mathematical formulation of these methods to facilitate applications and implementations of network-based analysis in the practice of precision oncology.

	abstract = {Background: Nearly half of the world's population (3.2 billion people) were at risk of malaria in 2015, and resistance to current therapies is a major concern. While the standard of care includes drug combinations, there is a pressing need to identify new combinations that can bypass current resistance mechanisms. In the work presented here, a combined transcriptional drug repositioning/discovery and machine learning approach is proposed. Methods: The integrated approach utilizes gene expression data from patient-derived samples, in combination with large-scale anti-malarial combination screening data, to predict synergistic compound combinations for three Plasmodium falciparum strains (3D7, DD2 and HB3). Both single compounds and combinations predicted to be active were prospectively tested in experiment. Results: One of the predicted single agents, apicidin, was active with the AC50 values of 74.9, 84.1 and 74.9 nM in 3D7, DD2 and HB3 P. falciparum strains while its maximal safe plasma concentration in human is 547.6 ± 136.6 nM. Apicidin at the safe dose of 500 nM kills on average 97\% of the parasite. The synergy prediction algorithm exhibited overall precision and recall of 83.5 and 65.1\% for mild-to-strong, 48.8 and 75.5\% for moderate-to-strong and 12.0 and 62.7\% for strong synergies. Some of the prospectively predicted combinations, such as tacrolimus-hydroxyzine and raloxifene-thioridazine, exhibited significant synergy across the three P. falciparum strains included in the study. Conclusions: Systematic approaches can play an important role in accelerating discovering novel combinational therapies for malaria as it enables selecting novel synergistic compound pairs in a more informed and cost-effective manner.},

	abstract = {Computational drug repositioning has been proven as a promising and efficient strategy for discovering new uses from existing drugs. To achieve this goal, a number of computational methods have been proposed, which are based on different data sources of drugs and diseases. These methods approach the problem using either machine learningor network-based models with an assumption that similar drugs can be used for similar diseases to identify new indications of drugs. Therefore, similarities between drugs and between diseases are usually used as inputs. In addition, known drug-disease associations are also needed for the methods as prior information. It should be noted that those associations are still not well established due to the fact that many of marketed drugs have been withdrawn and this could affect the outcome of the methods. In this study, we propose a novel method named RLSDR (Regularized Least Square for Drug Repositioning) to find new uses of drugs. More specifically, it relies on a semi-supervised learning model, Regularized Least Square, thus it does not require definition of non-drug-disease associations as previously proposed machine learning-based methods. In addition, the similarity between drugs measured by chemical structures of drug compounds and the similarity between diseases which share phenotypes can be represented in a form of either similarity network or similarity matrix as inputs of the method. Moreover, instead of using a gold-standard set of known drug-disease associations, we construct an artificial set of the associations based on known disease-gene and drugtarget associations. Experiment results demonstrate that RLSDR achieves better prediction performance on the artificial set of drug-disease associations than that on the gold-standard ones in terms of area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). In addition, it outperforms two representative network-based methods irrespective of the prior information of drug-disease associations. Novel indications for a number of drugs are also identified and validated by evidences from a different data resource.},

	abstract = {Background: Identifying new potential treatment options for medical conditions that cause human disease burden is a central task of biomedical research. Since all candidate drugs cannot be tested with animal and clinical trials, in vitro approaches are first attempted to identify promising candidates. Likewise, identifying different causal relations between biomedical entities is also critical to understand biomedical processes. Generally, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning are used to predict specific relations between any given pair of entities using the distant supervision approach. Objective: To build high accuracy supervised predictive models to predict previously unknown treatment and causative relations between biomedical entities based only on semantic graph pattern features extracted from biomedical knowledge graphs. Methods: We used 7000 treats and 2918 causes hand-curated relations from the UMLS Metathesaurus to train and test our models. Our graph pattern features are extracted from simple paths connecting biomedical entities in the SemMedDB graph (based on the well-known SemMedDB database made available by the U.S. National Library of Medicine). Using these graph patterns connecting biomedical entities as features of logistic regression and decision tree models, we computed mean performance measures (precision, recall, F-score) over 100 distinct 80–20\% train-test splits of the datasets. For all experiments, we used a positive:negative class imbalance of 1:10 in the test set to model relatively more realistic scenarios. Results: Our models predict treats and causes relations with high F-scores of 99\% and 90\% respectively. Logistic regression model coefficients also help us identify highly discriminative patterns that have an intuitive interpretation. We are also able to predict some new plausible relations based on false positives that our models scored highly based on our collaborations with two physician co-authors. Finally, our decision tree models are able to retrieve over 50\% of treatment relations from a recently created external dataset. Conclusions: We employed semantic graph patterns connecting pairs of candidate biomedical entities in a knowledge graph as features to predict treatment/causative relations between them. We provide what we believe is the first evidence in direct prediction of biomedical relations based on graph features. Our work complements lexical pattern based approaches in that the graph patterns can be used as additional features for weakly supervised relation prediction.},

	abstract = {In the era of precision medicine, cancer therapy can be tailored to an individual patient based on the genomic profile of a tumour. Despite the ever-increasing abundance of cancer genomic data, linking mutation profiles to drug efficacy remains a challenge. Herein, we report Cancer Drug Response profile scan (CDRscan) a novel deep learning model that predicts anticancer drug responsiveness based on a large-scale drug screening assay data encompassing genomic profiles of 787 human cancer cell lines and structural profiles of 244 drugs. CDRscan employs a two-step convolution architecture, where the genomic mutational fingerprints of cell lines and the molecular fingerprints of drugs are processed individually, then merged by 'virtual docking', an in silico modelling of drug treatment. Analysis of the goodness-of-fit between observed and predicted drug response revealed a high prediction accuracy of CDRscan (R2 {\textgreater} 0.84; AUROC {\textgreater} 0.98). We applied CDRscan to 1,487 approved drugs and identified 14 oncology and 23 non-oncology drugs having new potential cancer indications. This, to our knowledge, is the first-time application of a deep learning model in predicting the feasibility of drug repurposing. By further clinical validation, CDRscan is expected to allow selection of the most effective anticancer drugs for the genomic profile of the individual patient.},

First, we briefly introduce the datasets and data, and summarize features for drugs and targets which can be extracted from different data. Since drug-drug similarity and target-target similarity are important for many machine learning prediction models, we introduce how to calculate similarities based on data or features.

	abstract = {Conventional drug discovery in general is costly and time-consuming with extremely low success and relatively high attrition rates. The disparity between high cost of drug discovery and vast unmet medical needs resulted in advent of an increasing number of computational approaches that can “connect” disease with a candidate therapeutic. This includes computational drug repurposing or repositioning wherein the goal is to discover a new indication for an approved drug. Computational drug discovery approaches that are commonly used are similarity-based wherein network analysis or machine learning-based methods are used. One such approach is matching gene expression signatures from disease to those from small molecules, commonly referred to as connectivity mapping. In this chapter, we will focus on how publicly available existing transcriptomic data from diseases can be reused to identify novel candidate therapeutics and drug repositioning candidates. To elucidate these, we will present two case studies: (1) using transcriptional signature similarity or positive correlation to identify novel small molecules that are similar to an approved drug and (2) identifying candidate therapeutics via reciprocal connectivity or negative correlation between transcriptional signatures from a disease and small molecule.},

	abstract = {The drug discovery process is conventionally regarded as resource intensive and complex. Therefore, research effort has been put into a process called drug repositioning with the use of computational methods. Similarity-based methods are common in predicting drug-target association or the interaction between drugs and targets based on various features the drugs and targets have. Heterogeneous network topology involving many biomedical entities interactions has yet to be used in drug-target association. Deep learning can disclose features of vertices in a large network, which can be incorporated with heterogeneous network topology in order to assist similarity-based solutions to provide more flexibility for drug-target prediction. Here we describe a similarity-based drug-target prediction method that utilizes a topology-based similarity measure and two inference methods based on the similarities. We used DeepWalk, a deep learning method, to calculate the vertex similarities based on Linked Tripartite Network (LTN), which is a heterogeneous network created from different biomedical-linked datasets. The similarities are further used to feed to the inference methods, drug-based similarity inference (DBSI) and target-based similarity inference (TBSI), to obtain the predicted drug-target associations. Our previous experiments have shown that by utilizing deep learning and heterogeneous network topology, the proposed method can provide more promising results than current topology-based similarity computation methods.},

There are 23 NTDs that have been prioritized by the World Health Organization, which are endemic in 149 countries and affect more than 1.4 billion people, costing these developing economies billions of dollars annually. The NTDs result from four different causative pathogens: protozoa, bacteria, helminth and virus. The majority of the diseases lack effective treatments. Therefore, new therapeutics for NTDs are desperately needed. Methods: We describe various high throughput screening and computational approaches that have been performed in recent years. We have collated the molecules identified in these studies and calculated molecular properties. Results: Numerous global repurposing efforts have yielded some promising compounds for various neglected tropical diseases. These compounds when analyzed as one would expect appear drug-like. Several large datasets are also now in the public domain and this enables machine learning models to be constructed that then facilitate the discovery of new molecules for these pathogens. Conclusions: In the space of a few years many groups have either performed experimental or computational repurposing high throughput screens against neglected diseases. These have identified compounds which in many cases are already approved drugs. Such approaches perhaps offer a more efficient way to develop treatments which are generally not a focus for global pharmaceutical companies because of the economics or the lack of a viable market. Other diseases could perhaps benefit from these repurposing approaches.},

	abstract = {Background: Drug repositioning is a promising and efficient way to discover new indications for existing drugs, which holds the great potential for precision medicine in the post-genomic era. Many network-based approaches have been proposed for drug repositioning based on similarity networks, which integrate multiple sources of drugs and diseases. However, these methods may simply view nodes as the same-typed and neglect the semantic meanings of different meta-paths in the heterogeneous network. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a rational method to infer new indications for approved drugs. Results: In this study, we proposed a novel methodology named HeteSim\_DrugDisease (HSDD) for the prediction of drug repositioning. Firstly, we build the drug-drug similarity network and disease-disease similarity network by integrating the information of drugs and diseases. Secondly, a drug-disease heterogeneous network is constructed, which combines the drug similarity network, disease similarity network as well as the known drug-disease association network. Finally, HSDD predicts novel drug-disease associations based on the HeteSim scores of different meta-paths. The experimental results show that HSDD performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art approaches. HSDD achieves an AUC score of 0.8994 in the leave-one-out cross validation experiment. Moreover, case studies for selected drugs further illustrate the practical usefulness of HSDD. Conclusions: HSDD can be an effective and feasible way to infer the associations between drugs and diseases using on meta-path-based semantic network analysis.},

The Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform performs shotgun repurposing of 2030 indications/diseases using 3733 drugs/compounds to predict interactions with 46,784 proteins and relating them via proteomic interaction signatures. The accuracy is calculated by comparing interaction similarities of drugs approved for the same indications. We performed a unique subset analysis by breaking down the full protein library into smaller subsets and then recombining the best performing subsets into larger supersets. Up to 14\% improvement in accuracy is seen upon benchmarking the supersets, representing a 100–1000-fold reduction in the number of proteins considered relative to the full library. Further analysis revealed that libraries comprised of proteins with more equitably diverse ligand interactions are important for describing compound behavior. Using one of these libraries to generate putative drug candidates against malaria, tuberculosis, and large cell carcinoma results in more drugs that could be validated in the biomedical literature compared to using those suggested by the full protein library. Our work elucidates the role of particular protein subsets and corresponding ligand interactions that play a role in drug repurposing, with implications for drug design and machine learning approaches to improve the CANDO platform.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE The high attrition rate of cancer drug development programs is a barrier to realizing the promise of precision oncology. We have examined whether the genetic insights from genome-wide association studies of cancer can guide drug development and repurposing in oncology. MATERIALS AND METHODS Across 37 cancers, we identified 955 genetic risk variants from the National Human Genome Research Institute-European Bioinformatics Institute genome-wide association study catalog. We linked these variants to target genes using strategies that were based on linkage disequilibrium, DNA three-dimensional structure, and integration of predicted gene function and expression. With the use of the Informa Pharmaprojects database, we identified genes that are targets of unique drugs and assessed the level of enrichment that would be afforded by incorporation of genetic information in preclinical and phase II studies. For targets not under development, we implemented machine learning approaches to assess druggability. RESULTS For all preclinical targets incorporating genetic information, a 2.00-fold enrichment of a drug being successfully approved could be achieved (95\% CI, 1.14- to 3.48-fold; P = .02). For phase II targets, a 2.75-fold enrichment could be achieved (95\% CI, 1.42- to 5.35-fold; P {\textless} .001). Application of genetic information suggests potential repurposing of 15 approved nononcology drugs. CONCLUSION The findings illustrate the value of using insights from the genetics of inherited cancer susceptibility discovery projects as part of a data-driven strategy to inform drug discovery.

Prediction is based on the principle of chemical similarity (similar drugs bind similar targets) or on first principles from the biophysics of molecular interactions. In the first case, compound comparison is made through ligand-based chemical similarity search or through classifier-based machine learning approach. The 3D techniques are based on 3D structural descriptors or energy-based scoring scheme to infer a binding affinity of a compound with its putative target. More recently, a new approach based on compound set metric has been proposed in which a query compound is compared with a whole of compounds associated with a target or a family of targets.

	abstract = {Background: Traditional methods for drug discovery are time-consuming and expensive, so efforts are being made to repurpose existing drugs. To find new ways for drug repurposing, many computational approaches have been proposed to predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the data sets extracted from drugs and targets, traditional machine learning approaches, such as logistic regression analysis, cannot analyze these data sets efficiently. To overcome this issue, we propose LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)-based regularized linear classification models and a LASSO-DNN (Deep Neural Network) model based on LASSO feature selection to predict DTIs. These methods are demonstrated for repurposing drugs for breast cancer treatment. Methods: We collected drug descriptors, protein sequence data from Drugbank and protein domain information from NCBI. Validated DTIs were downloaded from Drugbank. A new similarity-based approach was developed to build the negative DTIs. We proposed multiple LASSO models to integrate different combinations of feature sets to explore the prediction power and predict DTIs. Furthermore, building on the features extracted from the LASSO models with the best performance, we also introduced a LASSO-DNN model to predict DTIs. The performance of our newly proposed DNN model (LASSO-DNN) was compared with the LASSO, standard logistic (SLG) regression, support vector machine (SVM), and standard DNN models. Results: Experimental results showed that the LASSO-DNN over performed the SLG, LASSO, SVM and standard DNN models. In particular, the LASSO models with protein tripeptide composition (TC) features and domain features were superior to those that contained other protein information, which may imply that TC and domain information could be better representations of proteins. Furthermore, we showed that the top ranked DTIs predicted using the LASSO-DNN model can potentially be used for repurposing existing drugs for breast cancer based on risk gene information. Conclusions: In summary, we demonstrated that the efficient representations of drug and target features are key for building learning models for predicting DTIs. The disease-associated risk genes identified from large-scale genomic studies are the potential drug targets, which can be used for drug repurposing.},

Unlike the design of(entity, predicate, entity) triples in a traditional three way tensor, a four way and a five way tensor, GMFD-/GMAFD-tensor, were designed to represent higher order links among or among part of these entities: genes(G), mutations(M), functions(F), diseases(D) and annotation labels(A). A tensor decomposition algorithm, CP decomposition, was applied to the higher order tensor and to unveil the correlation among entities. Meanwhile, a state-of-the-art baseline tensor decomposition algorithm, RESCAL, was carried on the three way tensor as a comparing method. The result showed that CP decomposition on higher order tensor performed better than RESCAL on traditional three way tensor in recovering masked data and making predictions. In addition, The four way tensor was proved to be the best format for our issue. At the end, a case study reproducing two disease-gene-drug links(Myelodysplatic Syndromes-IL2RA-Aldesleukin, Lymphoma-IL2RA-Aldesleukin) presented the feasibility of our prediction model for drug repurposing.},

Considering the high prevalence of chronic pain, the lack of sufficient efficacy and the safety issues of current analgesics, repositioning seems to be an attractive approach.

Historically, serendipity has contributed significantly to identifying many new drug indications. If patient-reported serendipitous drug usage in social media could be computationally identified, it could help generate and validate drug-repositioning hypotheses. We investigated deep neural network models for mining serendipitous drug usage from social media. We used the word2vec algorithm to construct word-embedding features from drug reviews posted in a WebMD patient forum. We adapted and redesigned the convolutional neural network, long short-term memory network, and convolutional long short-term memory network by adding contextual information extracted from drug-review posts, information-filtering tools, medical ontology, and medical knowledge. We trained, tuned, and evaluated our models with a gold-standard dataset of 15714 sentences (447 [2.8\%] describing serendipitous drug usage). Additionally, we compared our deep neural networks to support vector machine, random forest, and AdaBoost.M1 algorithms. Context information helped to reduce the false-positive rate of deep neural network models. If we used an extremely imbalanced dataset with limited instances of serendipitous drug usage, deep neural network models did not outperform other machine-learning models with n-gram and context features. However, deep neural network models could more effectively use word embedding in feature construction, an advantage that makes them worthy of further investigation. Finally, we implemented natural-language processing and machine-learning methods in a web-based application to help scientists and software developers mine social media for serendipitous drug usage.},

Such drug repurposing promises faster access of drugs to patients while reducing costs in the long and difficult process of drug development. However, the number of existing drugs and diseases, together with the heterogeneity of patients and diseases, notably including cancers, can make repurposing time consuming and inefficient. The key question we address is how to efficiently repurpose an existing drug to treat a given indication. As drug efficacy remains the main bottleneck for overall success, we discuss the need for machine-learning computational methods in combination with specific phenotypic studies along with mechanistic studies, chemical genetics and omics assays to successfully predict disease-drug pairs. Such a pipeline could be particularly important to cancer patients who face heterogeneous, recurrent and metastatic disease and need fast and personalized treatments. Here we focus on drug repurposing for colorectal cancer and describe selected therapeutics already repositioned for its prevention and/or treatment as well as potential candidates. We consider this review as a selective compilation of approaches and methodologies, and argue how, taken together, they could bring drug repurposing to the next level.},

Besides, many researchers have proposed various methods and databases for the repurposing of various drugs. However, there is not a proper and well-organized database available. To this end, for the first time, we developed a new database based on DrugBank and KEGG data, which is named “DrugR+”. Our developed database provides some advantages relative to the DrugBank, and its interface supplies new capabilities for both single and synthetic repositioning of drugs. Moreover, it includes four new datasets which can be used for predicting drug-target interactions using supervised machine learning methods. As a case study, we introduced novel applications of some drugs and discussed the obtained results. A comparison of several machine learning methods on the generated datasets has also been reported in the Supplementary File. Having included several normalized tables, DrugR + has been organized to provide key information on data structures for the repurposing and combining applications of drugs. It provides the SQL query capability for professional users and an appropriate method with different options for unprofessional users. Additionally, DrugR + consists of repurposing service that accepts a drug and proposes a list of potential drugs for some usages.

Methods: We developed the very efficient FASTCORMICS RNA-seq workflow (rFASTCORMICS) to build 10,005 high-resolution metabolic models from the TCGA dataset to capture metabolic rewiring strategies in cancer cells. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was used as a test case for a repurposing workflow based on rFASTCORMICS. Findings: Alternative pathways that are not required for proliferation or survival tend to be shut down and, therefore, tumours display cancer-specific essential genes that are significantly enriched for known drug targets. We identified naftifine, ketoconazole, and mimosine as new potential CRC drugs, which were experimentally validated. Interpretation: The here presented rFASTCORMICS workflow successfully reconstructs a metabolic model based on RNA-seq data and successfully predicted drug targets and drugs not yet indicted for colorectal cancer.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Traditional drug discovery and development are often time-consuming and high risk. Repurposing/repositioning of approved drugs offers a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency approach toward rapid development of efficacious treatments. The emergence of large-scale, heterogeneous biological networks has offered unprecedented opportunities for developing in silico drug repositioning approaches. However, capturing highly non-linear, heterogeneous network structures by most existing approaches for drug repositioning has been challenging. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a network-based deep-learning approach, termed deepDR, for in silico drug repurposing by integrating 10 networks: one drug-disease, one drug-side-effect, one drug-target and seven drug-drug networks. Specifically, deepDR learns high-level features of drugs from the heterogeneous networks by a multi-modal deep autoencoder. Then the learned low-dimensional representation of drugs together with clinically reported drug-disease pairs are encoded and decoded collectively via a variational autoencoder to infer candidates for approved drugs for which they were not originally approved. We found that deepDR revealed high performance [the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.908], outperforming conventional network-based or machine learning-based approaches. Importantly, deepDR-predicted drug-disease associations were validated by the ClinicalTrials.gov database (AUROC = 0.826) and we showcased several novel deepDR-predicted approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. risperidone and aripiprazole) and Parkinson's disease (e.g. methylphenidate and pergolide).

	abstract = {Background: Drug repositioning, also known as drug repurposing, defines new indications for existing drugs and can be used as an alternative to drug development. In recent years, the accumulation of large volumes of information related to drugs and diseases has led to the development of various computational approaches for drug repositioning. Although herbal medicines have had a great impact on current drug discovery, there are still a large number of herbal compounds that have no definite indications. Results: In the present study, we constructed a computational model to predict the unknown pharmacological effects of herbal compounds using machine learning techniques. Based on the assumption that similar diseases can be treated with similar drugs, we used four categories of drug-drug similarity (e.g., chemical structure, side-effects, gene ontology, and targets) and three categories of disease-disease similarity (e.g., phenotypes, human phenotype ontology, and gene ontology). Then, associations between drug and disease were predicted using the employed similarity features. The prediction models were constructed using classification algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine algorithms. Upon cross-validation, the random forest approach showed the best performance (AUC = 0.948) and also performed well in an external validation assessment using an unseen independent dataset (AUC = 0.828). Finally, the constructed model was applied to predict potential indications for existing drugs and herbal compounds. As a result, new indications for 20 existing drugs and 31 herbal compounds were predicted and validated using clinical trial data. Conclusions: The predicted results were validated manually confirming the performance and underlying mechanisms - for example, irinotecan as a treatment for neuroblastoma. From the prediction, herbal compounds were considered to be drug candidates for related diseases which is important to be further developed. The proposed prediction model can contribute to drug discovery by suggesting drug candidates from herbal compounds which have potentials but few were studied.},

In this paper, a novel feature learning method based on Gaussian interaction profile kernel and autoencoder (GIPAE) is proposed for drug-disease association. In order to further reduce the computation cost, both batch normalization layer and the full-connected layer are introduced to reduce training complexity. The experimental results of 10-fold cross validation indicate that the proposed method achieves superior performance on Fdataset and Cdataset with the AUCs of 93.30\% and 96.03\%, respectively, which were higher than many previous computational models. To further assess the accuracy of GIPAE, we conducted case studies on two complex human diseases. The top 20 drugs predicted, 14 obesity-related drugs, and 11 drugs related to Alzheimer's disease were validated in the CTD database. The results of cross validation and case studies indicated that GIPAE is a reliable model for predicting drug-disease associations.},

Various machine learning models have been developed over the years to predict such interactions. Multi-output learning models in particular have drawn the attention of the scientific community due to their high predictive performance and computational efficiency. These models are based on the assumption that all the labels are correlated with each other. However, this assumption is too optimistic. Here, we address drug-target interaction prediction as a multi-label classification task that is combined with label partitioning.

	abstract = {Background: Detection of new drug-target interactions by computational algorithms is of crucial value to both old drug repositioning and new drug discovery. Existing machine-learning methods rely only on experimentally validated drug-target interactions (i.e., positive samples) for the predictions. Their performance is severely impeded by the lack of reliable negative samples. Results: We propose a method to construct highly-reliable negative samples for drug target prediction by a pairwise drug-target similarity measurement and OCSVM with a high-recall constraint. On one hand, we measure the pairwise similarity between every two drug-target interactions by combining the chemical similarity between their drugs and the Gene Ontology-based similarity between their targets. Then we calculate the accumulative similarity with all known drug-target interactions for each unobserved drug-target interaction. On the other hand, we obtain the signed distance from OCSVM learned from the known interactions with high recall (≥0.95) for each unobserved drug-target interaction. After normalizing all accumulative similarities and signed distances to the range [0,1], we compute the score for each unobserved drug-target interaction via averaging its accumulative similarity and signed distance. Unobserved interactions with lower scores are preferentially served as reliable negative samples for the classification algorithms. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the interaction data between 1094 drugs and 1556 target proteins. Extensive comparison experiments using four classical classifiers and one domain predictive method demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. A better decision boundary has been learned from the constructed reliable negative samples. Conclusions: Proper construction of highly-reliable negative samples can help the classification models learn a clear decision boundary which contributes to the performance improvement.},

Advanced “omics” coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence (deep learning) methods have helped elucidate targets and pathways critical to those processes that may be amenable to pharmacologic modulation. However, the current anti-cancer therapeutic armamentarium continues to lag behind. As the cost of developing a new drug remains prohibitively expensive, repurposing of existing approved and investigational drugs is sought after given known safety profiles and reduction in the cost barrier. Notably, successes in oncologic drug repurposing have been infrequent. Computational in-silico strategies have been developed to aid in modeling biological processes to find new disease-relevant targets and discovering novel drug-target and drug-phenotype associations.

	abstract = {Identifying new relations between medical entities, such as drugs, diseases, and side effects, is typically a resource-intensive task, involving experimentation and clinical trials. The increased availability of related data and curated knowledge enables a computational approach to this task, notably by training models to predict likely relations. Such models rely on meaningful representations of the medical entities being studied. We propose a generic features vector representation that leverages co-occurrences of medical terms, linked with PubMed citations.We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed representation by inferring two types of relations: a drug causes a side effect and a drug treats an indication. To predict these relations and assess their effectiveness, we applied 2 modeling approaches: multi-task modeling using neural networks and single-task modeling based on gradient boosting machines and logistic regression.These trained models, which predict either side effects or indications, obtained significantly better results than baseline models that use a single direct co-occurrence feature. The results demonstrate the advantage of a comprehensive representation.Selecting the appropriate representation has an immense impact on the predictive performance of machine learning models. Our proposed representation is powerful, as it spans multiple medical domains and can be used to predict a wide range of relation types.The discovery of new relations between various medical entities can be translated into meaningful insights, for example, related to drug development or disease understanding. Our representation of medical entities can be used to train models that predict such relations, thus accelerating healthcare-related discoveries.},

	abstract = {RNA editing critically regulates neurodevelopment and normal neuronal function. The global landscape of RNA editing was surveyed across 364 schizophrenia cases and 383 control postmortem brain samples from the CommonMind Consortium, comprising two regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. In schizophrenia, RNA editing sites in genes encoding AMPA-type glutamate receptors and postsynaptic density proteins were less edited, whereas those encoding translation initiation machinery were edited more. These sites replicate between brain regions, map to 3′-untranslated regions and intronic regions, share common sequence motifs and overlap with binding sites for RNA-binding proteins crucial for neurodevelopment. These findings cross-validate in hundreds of non-overlapping dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples. Furthermore, {\textasciitilde}30\% of RNA editing sites associate with cis-regulatory variants (editing quantitative trait loci or edQTLs). Fine-mapping edQTLs with schizophrenia risk loci revealed co-localization of eleven edQTLs with six loci. The findings demonstrate widespread altered RNA editing in schizophrenia and its genetic regulation, and suggest a causal and mechanistic role of RNA editing in schizophrenia neuropathology.},

	abstract = {The recoding of genetic information through RNA editing contributes to proteomic diversity, but the extent and significance of RNA editing in disease is poorly understood. In particular, few studies have investigated the relationship between RNA editing and disease at a genome-wide level. Here, we developed a framework for the genome-wide detection of RNA sites that are differentially edited in disease. Using RNA-sequencing data from 100 hippocampi from mice with epilepsy (pilocarpine-temporal lobe epilepsy model) and 100 healthy control hippocampi, we identified 256 RNA sites (overlapping with 87 genes) that were significantly differentially edited between epileptic cases and controls. The degree of differential RNA editing in epileptic mice correlated with frequency of seizures, and the set of genes differentially RNA-edited between case and control mice were enriched for functional terms highly relevant to epilepsy, including "neuron projection" and "seizures." Genes with differential RNA editing were preferentially enriched for genes with a genetic association to epilepsy. Indeed, we found that they are significantly enriched for genes that harbor nonsynonymous de novo mutations in patients with epileptic encephalopathy and for common susceptibility variants associated with generalized epilepsy. These analyses reveal a functional convergence between genes that are differentially RNA-edited in acquired symptomatic epilepsy and those that contribute risk for genetic epilepsy. Taken together, our results suggest a potential role for RNA editing in the epileptic hippocampus in the occurrence and severity of epileptic seizures.},

Thus, we investigated the diversity of the microbiome in the four major types of breast cancer: endocrine receptor (ER) positive, triple positive, Her2 positive and triple negative breast cancers. Using a whole genome and transcriptome amplification and a pan-pathogen microarray (PathoChip) strategy, we detected unique and common viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic signatures for each of the breast cancer types. These were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the breast cancer samples, based on their detected microbial signatures, showed distinct patterns for the triple negative and triple positive samples, while the ER positive and Her2 positive samples shared similar microbial signatures. These signatures, unique or common to the different breast cancer types, provide a new line of investigation to gain further insights into prognosis, treatment strategies and clinical outcome, as well as better understanding of the role of the micro-organisms in the development and progression of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer affects one in eight women in their lifetime. Though diet, age and genetic predisposition are established risk factors, the majority of breast cancers have unknown etiology. The human microbiota refers to the collection of microbes inhabiting the human body. Imbalance in microbial communities, or microbial dysbiosis, has been implicated in various human diseases including obesity, diabetes, and colon cancer. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of microbiota in breast cancer by next-generation sequencing using breast tumor tissue and paired normal adjacent tissue from the same patient. In a qualitative survey of the breast microbiota DNA, we found that the bacterium Methylobacterium radiotolerans is relatively enriched in tumor tissue, while the bacterium Sphingomonas yanoikuyae is relatively enriched in paired normal tissue. The relative abundances of these two bacterial species were inversely correlated in paired normal breast tissue but not in tumor tissue, indicating that dysbiosis is associated with breast cancer. Furthermore, the total bacterial DNA load was reduced in tumor versus paired normal and healthy breast tissue as determined by quantitative PCR. Interestingly, bacterial DNA load correlated inversely with advanced disease, a finding that could have broad implications in diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. Lastly, we observed lower basal levels of antibacterial response gene expression in tumor versus healthy breast tissue. Taken together, these data indicate that microbial DNA is present in the breast and that bacteria or their components may influence the local immune microenvironment. Our findings suggest a previously unrecognized link between dysbiosis and breast cancer which has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications. © 2014 Xuan et al.},

In this review we discuss the changes to the metabolism of breast cancer cells, as well as the composition of the breast and gut microbiome in breast cancer. The role of the breast microbiome in breast cancer is unresolved, nevertheless it seems that the gut microbiome does have a role in the pathology of the disease. The gut microbiome secretes bioactive metabolites (reactivated estrogens, short chain fatty acids, amino acid metabolites, or secondary bile acids) that modulate breast cancer. We highlight the bacterial species or taxonomical units that generate these metabolites, we show their mode of action, and discuss how the metabolites affect mitochondrial metabolism and other molecular events in breast cancer. These metabolites resemble human hormones, as they are produced in a “gland” (in this case, the microbiome) and they are subsequently transferred to distant sites of action through the circulation. These metabolites appear to be important constituents of the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we discuss how bacterial dysbiosis interferes with breast cancer treatment through interfering with chemotherapeutic drug metabolism and availability.},

	abstract = {© 2017, © International Headache Society 2017. Background: The trigeminal ganglion contains neurons that relay sensations of pain, touch, pressure, and many other somatosensory modalities to the central nervous system. The ganglion is also a reservoir for latent herpes virus 1 infection. To gain a better understanding of molecular factors contributing to migraine and headache, transcriptome analyses were performed on postmortem human trigeminal ganglia. Methods: RNA-Seq measurements of gene expression were conducted on small sub-regions of 16 human trigeminal ganglia. The samples were also characterized for transcripts derived from viral and microbial genomes. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) antibodies in blood were measured using the luciferase immunoprecipitation assay. Results: Observed molecular heterogeneity could be explained by sampling of anatomically distinct sub-regions of the excised ganglia consistent with neurally-enriched and non-neural, i.e. Schwann cell, enriched subregions. The levels of HSV-1 transcripts detected in trigeminal ganglia correlated with blood levels of HSV-1 antibodies. Multiple migraine susceptibility genes were strongly expressed in neurally-enriched trigeminal samples, while others were expressed in blood vessels. Conclusions: These data provide a comprehensive human trigeminal transcriptome and a framework for evaluation of inhomogeneous post-mortem tissues through extensive quality control and refined downstream analyses for RNA-Seq methodologies. Expression profiling of migraine susceptibility genes identified by genetic association appears to emphasize the blood vessel component of the trigeminovascular system. Other genes displayed enriched expression in the trigeminal compared to dorsal root ganglion, and in-depth transcriptomic analysis of the KCNK18 gene underlying familial migraine shows selective neural expression within two specific populations of ganglionic neurons. These data suggest that expression profiling of migraine-associated genes can extend and amplify the underlying neurobiological insights obtained from genetic association studies.},

	abstract = {The thanatomicrobiome (thanatos, Greek for death) is a relatively new term and is the study of the microbes colonizing the internal organs and orifices after death. Recent scientific breakthroughs in an initial study of the thanatomicrobiome have revealed that a majority of the microbes within the human body are the obligate anaerobes, Clostridium spp., in the internal postmortem microbial communities. We hypothesized that time-dependent changes in the thanatomicrobiome within internal organs can estimate the time of death as a human body decays. Here we report a cross-sectional study of the sampling of 27 human corpses from criminal cases with postmortem intervals between 3.5-240 hours. The impetus for examining microbial communities in different internal organs is to address the paucity of empirical data on thanatomicrobiomic succession caused by the limited access to these organs prior to death and a dearth of knowledge regarding the movement of microbes within remains. Our sequencing results of 16S rRNA gene amplicons of 27 postmortem samples from cadavers demonstrated statistically significant time-, organ-, and sex-dependent changes. These results suggest that comprehensive knowledge of the number and abundance of each organ's signature microorganisms could be useful to forensic microbiologists as a new source of data for estimating postmortem interval.},

Using DNA microarray technology, this study investigates differences in transcriptional profiles of highly divergent brain regions (the cerebellar cortex and the cerebral cortex) as well as differences between two closely related brain structures (the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Replication of this study across three independent laboratories, to address false-positive and false-negative results using microarray technology, is also discussed. We find greater than a thousand transcripts to be differentially expressed between cerebellum and cerebral cortex and very few transcripts to be differentially expressed between the two neocortical regions. We further characterized transcripts that were found to be specifically expressed within brain regions being compared and found that ontological classes representing signal transduction machinery, neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, and transcription factors were most highly represented. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The development of the GABAergic system in the chick embryo telencephalon has been studied. Special emphasis was placed on the development of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) between embryonic day 8 (E8) and E17. The GABA immunoreactivity and neuron-specific enolase expression was detected simultaneously in glutardialdehyde fixed sections, which confirmed that GABAergic cells exhibit neuronal phenotype. The GAD expression was studied by means of immunohistochemistry on cryo-sectioned material both at the light and electron microscopic levels. Furthermore, the presence and localization of GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs were studied with an in situ hybridization technique with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes. Protein expression as well as mRNA appearance mostly coincided both temporally and spatially. In the parahippocampal area, as well as in other regions of the developing cortex, GAD staining was seen from E8 onwards. The number of positive cells increased as did the intensity of staining up to E14. As observed in the electron microscope, the GAD protein was co-localized with GABA in most cases, although some GAD-positive cells devoid of GABA-staining also were observed. The pattern of GAD mRNA expression was in general similar to that of GAD immunostaining. Both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA were detected during the entire period. Furthermore, GAD67 mRNA localization spatially was more correlated with GAD protein expression. The study provides evidence for the notion that development of the GABAergic system occurs rapidly during embryogenesis and, as suggested from mRNA data, that two forms of GAD with slight difference in distribution can contribute to this.},

Our results also reveal that ADAR regulates transcript stability and gene expression through interaction with HuR (ELAVL1).

Here, we present growing evidence that in many cases, aberrant mRNA transcripts contribute to essential phenotypes associated with transformed cells, suggesting that alterations in the splicing machinery are common and functionally important for cancer development. The proteins encoded by these abnormal transcripts are often truncated or missing domains, thereby altering protein function or conferring new functions altogether. Thus, aberrant splicing regulation has genome-wide effects, potentially altering gene expression in many cancer-associated pathways.},

Specific antibodies directed against each polypeptide chain were prepared in rabbits and used as structural and functional probes. With minor exceptions, each antibody recognized specifically the corresponding polypeptide by blot-immunodetection. Cross-reactions with purified RNA polymerases A and B confirmed our previous description of the subunits shared by the three nuclear RNA polymerases. Immunoadsorption of RNA polymerase C at different stages of purification using antibodies to subunits C160 and C128 yielded the same collection of polypeptides as found in the purified enzyme: C160, C128, C82, C53, C40, C37, C34, C31, C27, C25, C23, C19, C14.5, C12.5, and C10. Subunit-specific antibodies were used to probe the activity of RNA polymerase C in a specific, reconstituted transcription system as well as on a nonspecific template. Transcription of the tRNAGlu3 gene in vitro was inhibited when RNA polymerase C was preincubated with antibodies directed to C128, C82, C53, C34, C23, or C19. Antibodies to C82, C53, and C34 were much less inhibitory in the nonspecific assay. Inhibition by anti-C128 or anti-C23 was relieved by preincubation of enzyme C with plasmid DNA prior to antibody addition. These results are discussed in terms of the participation of these polypeptides to the active enzyme molecule, and of their possible role in DNA binding or transcription factor recognition.},

In Escherichia coli, overproduction of omega suppresses the assembly defect caused by substitution of residue 1362 of the largest subunit of RNAP, beta'. In yeast, overproduction of RPB6 suppresses the assembly defect caused by the equivalent substitution in the largest subunit of RNAP II, RPB1. High-resolution structural analysis of the omega-beta' interface in bacterial RNAP, and comparison with the RPB6-RPB1 interface in yeast RNAP II, confirms the structural relationship and suggests a "latching" mechanism for the role of omega and RPB6 in promoting RNAP assembly.},

	abstract = {The transcription of nucleus-encoded genes in eukaryotes is performed by three distinct RNA polymerases termed I, II, and III, each of which is a complex enzyme composed of more than 10 subunits. The isolation of genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic RNA polymerases from a wide spectrum of organisms has confirmed previous biochemical and immunological data indicating that all three enzymes are closely related in structures that have been conserved in evolution. Each RNA polymerase is an enzyme complex composed of two large subunits that are homologous to the two largest subunits of prokaryotic RNA polymerases and are associated with smaller polypeptides, some of which are common to two or to all three eukaryotic enzymes. This remarkable conservation of structure most probably underlies a conservation of function and emphasizes the likelihood that information gained from the study of RNA polymerases from one organism will be applicable to others. The recent isolation of many mutations affecting the structure and/or function of eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA polymerases now makes it feasible to begin integrating genetic and biochemical information from various species in order to develop a picture of these enzymes. The picture of eukaryotic RNA polymerases depicted in this article emphasizes the role(s) of different polypeptide regions in interaction with other subunits, cofactors, substrates, inhibitors, or accessory transcription factors, as well as the requirement for these interactions in transcription initiation, elongation, pausing, termination, and/or enzyme assembly. Most mutations described here have been isolated in eukaryotic organisms that have well-developed experimental genetic systems as well as amenable biochemistry, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. When relevant, mutations affecting regions of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase that are conserved among eukaryotes and prokaryotes are also presented. In addition to providing information about the structure and function of eukaryotic RNA polymerases, the study of mutations and of the pleiotropic phenotypes they imposed has underscored the central role played by these enzymes in many fundamental processes such as development and cellular differentiation.},

Complete definition of the three-dimensional structure of Pol II is essential for understanding the mechanisms that regulate transcription via protein-protein interactions within the Pol II apparatus. To date a series of Pol II-related crystal structures have been reported. However, certain peptide regions, including several that are implicated to interact with regulatory factors, remain obscure. Here we describe conformations for two such regions that are close to the Pol II surface and assume seemingly flexible loop structures. One is located in the TFIIF-interacting Protrusion domain, whereas the other is in the TFIIE-interacting Clamp domain. This structural definition was aided by the application of an advanced crystallographic refinement approach that utilizes the single anomalous diffraction (SAD) from zinc ions bound intrinsically in Pol II. The SAD-based strategy allowed the 12-subunit Pol II model to be fully refined up to 3.8Å with excellent stereochemical properties, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SAD approach for the refinement of large structures at low-to-moderate resolutions. Our results also define additional components of the free Pol II, including the functionally critical Fork Loop-1 and Fork Loop-2 elements. As such, this refined Pol II model provides the most complete structural reference for future analyses of complex structures formed between Pol II and its regulatory factors. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

The primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) contain cap structures as well as poly (A) tails, which are the unique properties of class II gene transcripts. The treatment of human cells with α-amanitin decreased the level of pri-miRNAs at a concentration that selectively inhibits pol II activity. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses show that pol II is physically associated with a miRNA promoter. We also describe, for the first time, the detailed structure of a miRNA gene by determining the promoter and the terminator of mir-23a∼27a∼24-2. These data indicate that pol II is the main, if not the only, RNA polymerase for miRNA gene transcription. Our study offers a basis for understanding the structure and regulation of miRNA genes.},

The CTD is subject to extensive post-translational modification, most notably phosphorylation, during the transcription cycle, which modulates its activities in the above processes. Therefore, understanding the nature of CTD modifications, including how they function and how they are regulated, is essential to understanding the mechanisms that control gene expression. While the significance of phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 residues has been studied and appreciated for some time, several additional modifications have more recently been added to the CTD repertoire, and insight into their function has begun to emerge. Here, we review findings regarding modification and function of the CTD, highlighting the important role this unique domain plays in coordinating gene activity. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

This investigation comprised two parts: the characterisation of 5-HT(2C)R RNA editing in a larger human control sample than previously examined, and a comparative study in subjects with schizophrenia. Secondary structure analysis of the putative edited region of the human 5-HT(2C)R gene predicted the existence of a double stranded (ds) RNA loop, essential for RNA editing in this receptor. RNA was then extracted from frontal cortex of five controls and five subjects with schizophrenia. RT-PCR products of the edited region were cloned and sequenced (n = 100). Reduced RNA editing, increased expression of the unedited 5-HT(2C-INI) isoform in schizophrenia (P = 0.001) and decreased expression of the 5-HT(2C-VSV) and 5-HT(2C-VNV) isoforms were detected in the schizophrenia group. In addition, two novel mRNA edited variants were identified: 5-HT(2C-MNI) and 5-HT(2C-VDI). Screening of the 5-HT(2C)R gene did not reveal any mutations likely to disrupt the dsRNA loop, suggesting that the reduced RNA editing in schizophrenia may instead be caused by altered activity of the editing enzyme(s). Since the unedited 5-HT(2C-INI) is more efficiently coupled to G proteins than the other isoforms, its increased expression in schizophrenia may lead to enhanced 5-HT(2C)R-mediated effects. The results also illustrate that potentially important receptor alterations may occur in schizophrenia which are not detectable merely in terms of receptor abundance.},

Since then, studies on ADARs in genetic model organisms, and evolutionary comparisons between them, continue to reveal a surprising range of pleiotropic biological effects of ADARs. This review focuses on Drosophila melanogaster, which has a single Adar gene encoding a homolog of vertebrate ADAR2 that site-specifically edits hundreds of transcripts to change individual codons in ion channel subunits and membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. Drosophila ADAR is involved in the control of neuronal excitability and neurodegeneration and, intriguingly, in the control of neuronal plasticity and sleep. Drosophila ADAR also interacts strongly with RNA interference, a key antiviral defense mechanism in invertebrates. Recent crystal structures of human ADAR2 deaminase domain-RNA complexes help to interpret available information on Drosophila ADAR isoforms and on the evolution of ADARs from tRNA deaminase ADAT proteins. ADAR RNA editing is a paradigm for the now rapidly expanding range of RNA modifications in mRNAs and ncRNAs. Even with recent progress, much remains to be understood about these groundbreaking ADAR RNA modification systems.},

	abstract = {The majority of effects of cannabinoids are mediated by the two receptors CB1 and CB2. In addition to neuronal cells, CB1 receptors are expressed in T lymphocytes, in which they are involved in cannabinoid-induced T helper cell biasing. Although basally expressed only weakly in T cells, CB1 receptors are up-regulated in these cells by stimuli such as cannabinoids themselves. This effect is mediated by interleukin-4. In this study, we investigated basal and interleukin-4-inducible expression of the CB1 gene in T lymphocytes. In a promoter analysis, two regions [nucleotides (nts) -3086 to -2490 and nts -1950 to -1653] were identified, which suppress basal transcription of the gene in Jurkat T cells, whereas the region between nts -648 and -559 enhanced basal CB1 transcription. Interleukin-4 markedly induced transcription of CB1 in Jurkat cells and primary human T cells. Experiments using transcription factor decoy oligonucleotides demonstrated that STAT6 mediates regulation of the gene by interleukin-4. Using reporter gene assays and the transcription factor decoy oligonucleotide approach, a binding site for STAT6 was identified at nt -2769 on the human CB1 gene promoter. Interleukin-4 also caused up-regulation of functional CB1 receptor proteins. In interleukin-4 pretreated, but not in naive Jurkat cells, the CB1 agonist R (+)-methanandamide caused a significant inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP formation. This effect was blocked by the CB1-selective antagonists N -(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1 H -pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251) and 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl- N -4-mo rpholinyl-1 H -pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM281). Taken together, these data show that CB1 receptors are expressed and up-regulated by interleukin-4 in T lymphocytes, which enables CB1-mediated communication to cells of other systems, such as neuronal cells.},

Detection of RNA editing sites (RESs) typically requires the filtering of SNVs called from RNA-seq data using an SNP database, an obstacle that is difficult to overcome for most organisms.

SPRINT also integrates the detection of hyper RESs from remapped reads, and has been fully automated to any RNA-seq data with reference genome sequence available. We have rigorously validated SPRINT's effectiveness in detecting RESs using RNA-seq data of samples in which genes encoding RNA editing enzymes are knock down or over-expressed, and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. We have applied SPRINT to investigate RNA editing across tissues and species, and also in the development of mouse embryonic central nervous system.

Since the contribution of astrocytes is found to be crucial not only in the modulation of the glutamatergic system but also in the maintenance of brain energy metabolism, alterations in the astrocytic function and neuroenergetic environment are suggested as the potential neurobiological underpinnings of mood disorders. In the present review, the evidence of glutamatergic abnormalities in mood disorders based on postmortem and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies is presented, and disrupted energy metabolism involving astrocytic dysfunction is proposed as the underlying mechanism linking altered energy metabolism, perturbations in the glutamatergic system, and pathogenesis of mood disorders.},

	abstract = {Glutamate receptor channels are built around an ancient pore loop structure which defines the inner channel environment and which is connected to structures for channel gating. This pore loop, which corresponds to the M2 region of the receptor subunits, enters the lipid bilayer from the intracellular side in an α-helical configuration, then kinks to form a random coil and exits the lipid bilayer at the intracellular side. The narrow constriction of the channel is formed by amino acid residues that occupy a position shortly after the end of the α-helical part of M2. These residues determine ion selectivity and conductance properties of the glutamate-gated channel. The critical residues are asparagines for NMDA receptor subunits and glutamine or arginine for AMPA and kainate receptor subunits. Presence of arginine in the critical channel position of AMPA and kainate receptors is controlled by site-selective RNA editing. To study the importance of these critical channel residues in the mouse, we introduced codon changes in the endogenous genes for NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits. Our results show that changes in the critical channel position are not tolerated, but lead to early death. Therefore, the impact on adult synaptic function and plasticity by glutamate receptor channels with changed ion selectivity and conductance needs to be addressed by conditional expression of the mutant receptors. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence points to an association between major depressive disorders (MDDs) and diverse types of GABAergic deficits. In this review, we summarize clinical and preclinical evidence supporting a central and causal role of GABAergic deficits in the etiology of depressive disorders. Studies of depressed patients indicate that MDDs are accompanied by reduced brain concentration of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and by alterations in the subunit composition of the principal receptors (GABA(A) receptors) mediating GABAergic inhibition. In addition, there is abundant evidence that suggests that GABA has a prominent role in the brain control of stress, the most important vulnerability factor in mood disorders. Furthermore, preclinical evidence suggests that currently used antidepressant drugs (ADs) designed to alter monoaminergic transmission and nonpharmacological therapies may ultimately act to counteract GABAergic deficits. In particular, GABAergic transmission has an important role in the control of hippocampal neurogenesis and neural maturation, which are now established as cellular substrates of most if not all antidepressant therapies. Finally, comparatively modest deficits in GABAergic transmission in GABA(A) receptor-deficient mice are sufficient to cause behavioral, cognitive, neuroanatomical and neuroendocrine phenotypes, as well as AD response characteristics expected of an animal model of MDD. The GABAergic hypothesis of MDD suggests that alterations in GABAergic transmission represent fundamentally important aspects of the etiological sequelae of MDDs that are reversed by monoaminergic AD action.},

Although clinically distinct, several disorders share many symptoms, suggesting common underlying molecular changes exist that may implicate important regulators of pathogenesis and provide new therapeutic targets. Methods: We performed RNA sequencing on tissue from the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens from three groups of 24 patients each diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, and from 24 control subjects. We identified differentially expressed genes and validated the results in an independent cohort. Anterior cingulate cortex samples were also subjected to metabolomic analysis. ChIP-seq data were used to characterize binding of the transcription factor EGR1. Results: We compared molecular signatures across the three brain regions and disorders in the transcriptomes of post-mortem human brain samples. The most significant disease-related differences were in the anterior cingulate cortex of schizophrenia samples compared to controls. Transcriptional changes were assessed in an independent cohort, revealing the transcription factor EGR1 as significantly down-regulated in both cohorts and as a potential regulator of broader transcription changes observed in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, broad down-regulation of genes specific to neurons and concordant up-regulation of genes specific to astrocytes was observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients relative to controls. Metabolomic profiling identified disruption of GABA levels in schizophrenia patients. Conclusions: We provide a comprehensive post-mortem transcriptome profile of three psychiatric disorders across three brain regions. We highlight a high-confidence set of independently validated genes differentially expressed between schizophrenia and control patients in the anterior cingulate cortex and integrate transcriptional changes with untargeted metabolite profiling.},

Genetic recoding by editing was so far observed for only a few mammalian RNAs that are predominantly expressed in nervous tissues. However, as these editing targets fail to explain the broad and severe phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice, additional targets for editing by ADARs were always expected. Using comparative genomics and expressed sequence analysis, we identified and experimentally verified four additional candidate human substrates for ADAR-mediated editing: FLNA, BLCAP, CYFIP2 and IGFBP7. Additionally, editing of three of these substrates was verified in the mouse while two of them were validated in chicken. Interestingly, none of these substrates encodes a receptor protein but two of them are strongly expressed in the CNS and seem important for proper nervous system function. The editing pattern observed suggests that some of the affected proteins might have altered physiological properties leaving the possibility that they can be related to the phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice. © The Author 2005.

Use of the cloned DNA as a molecular probe documented sequence conservation across mammals and detected a single transcript of 7 kb in RNA of all human tissues analyzed. The deduced primary structure of human DRADA revealed a bipartite nuclear localization signal, three repeats of a double-stranded RNA binding motif, and the presence of sequences conserved in the catalytic center of other deaminases, including a cytidine deaminase involved in the RNA editing of apolipoprotein B. These structural properties are consistent with the enzymatic signature of DRADA, and strengthen the hypothesis that DRADA carries out the RNA editing of transcripts encoding glutamate-gated ion channels in brain.},

	abstract = {A 6,474-nucleotide human cDNA clone designated K88, which encodes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific adenosine deaminase, was isolated in a screen for interferon (IFN)-regulated cDNAs. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that the K88 cDNA hybridized to a single major transcript of approximately 6.7 kb in human cells which was increased about fivefold by IFN treatment. Polyclonal antisera prepared against K88 cDNA products expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins recognized two proteins by Western (immunoblot) analysis. An IFN-induced 150-kDa protein and a constitutively expressed 110-kDa protein whose level was not altered by IFN treatment were detected in human amnion U and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines. Only the 150-kDa protein was detected in mouse fibroblasts with antiserum raised against the recombinant human protein; the mouse 150-kDa protein was IFN inducible. Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation analyses showed that the 110-kDa protein was exclusively nuclear, whereas the 150-kDa protein was present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of human cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the K88 cDNA includes three copies of the highly conserved R motif commonly found in dsRNA-binding proteins. Both the 150-kDa and the 110-kDa proteins prepared from human nuclear extracts bound to double-stranded but not to single-stranded RNA affinity columns. Furthermore, E. coli-expressed GST-K88 fusion proteins that included the R motif possessed dsRNA-binding activity. Extracts prepared either from K88 cDNA-transfected cells or from IFN-treated cells contained increased dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase enzyme activity. These results establish that K88 encodes an IFN-inducible dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase and suggest that at least two forms of dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase occur in human cells.},

Three vertebrate ADAR gene family members, ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3, have been identified. The catalytic domain of all three ADAR gene family members is very similar to that of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase and APOBEC-1. Homodimerization is essential for the enzyme activity of those cytidine deaminases. In this study, we investigated the formation of complexes between differentially epitope-tagged ADAR monomers by sequential affinity chromatography and size exclusion column chromatography. Both ADAR1 and ADAR2 form a stable enzymatically active homodimer complex, whereas ADAR3 remains as a monomeric, enzymatically inactive form. No heterodimer complex formation among different ADAR gene family members was detected. Analysis of HeLa and mouse brain nuclear extracts suggested that endogenous ADAR1 and ADAR2 both form a homodimer complex. Interestingly, endogenous ADAR3 also appears to form a homodimer complex, indicating the presence of a brain-specific mechanism for ADAR3 dimerization. Homodimer formation may be necessary for ADAR to act as active deaminases. Analysis of dimer complexes consisting of one wild-type and one mutant monomer suggests functional interactions between the two subunits during site-selective RNA editing.},

Currently, only a limited number of human ADAR substrates are known, whereas indirect evidence suggests a substantial fraction of all pre-mRNAs being affected. Here we describe a computational search for ADAR editing sites in the human transcriptome, using millions of available expressed sequences. We mapped 12,723 A-to-I editing sites in 1,637 different genes, with an estimated accuracy of 95\%, raising the number of known editing sites by two orders of magnitude. We experimentally validated our method by verifying the occurrence of editing in 26 novel substrates. A-to-I editing in humans primarily occurs in noncoding regions of the RNA, typically in Alu repeats. Analysis of the large set of editing sites indicates the role of editing in controlling dsRNA stability.},

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a widespread modification of the transcriptome. The editing level in humans is significantly higher compared with nonprimates, due to exceptional editing within the primate-specific Alu sequences, but the global editing level of nonhuman primates has not been studied so far. Herewereport the sequencing of transcribed Alu sequences in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys. We found that, on average, the editing level in the transcripts analyzed is higher in human brain compared with nonhuman primates, even where the genomic Alu structure is unmodified. Correlated editing is observed for pairs and triplets of specific adenosines along the Alu sequences. Moreover, new editable species-specific Alu insertions, subsequent to the human-chimpanzee split, are significantly enriched in genes related to neuronal functions and neurological diseases. The enhanced editing level in the human brain and the association with neuronal functions both hint at the possible contribution of A-to-I editing to the development of higher brain function. We show here that combinatorial editing is the most significant contributor to the transcriptome repertoire and suggest that Alu editing adapted by natural selection may therefore serve as an alternate information mechanism based on the binary A/I code.},

Both physiological and behavioral factors-including endothelial dysfunction, platelet abnormalities, inflammation, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and reduced engagement in health-promoting activities-may link depression with adverse cardiac outcomes. Because of the potential impact of depression on quality of life and cardiac outcomes, the American Heart Association has recommended routine depression screening of all cardiac patients with the 2- and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaires. However, despite the availability of these easy-to-use screening tools and effective treatments, depression is underrecognized and undertreated in patients with CVD. In this paper, we review the literature on epidemiology, phenomenology, comorbid conditions, and risk factors for depression in cardiac disease. We outline the associations between depression and cardiac outcomes, as well as the mechanisms that may mediate these links. Finally, we discuss the evidence for and against routine depression screening in patients with CVD and make specific recommendations for when and how to assess for depression in this high-risk population.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and depression are common. Patients with CVD have more depression than the general population. Persons with depression are more likely to eventually develop CVD and also have a higher mortality rate than the general population. Patients with CVD, who are also depressed, have a worse outcome than those patients who are not depressed. There is a graded relationship: the more severe the depression, the higher the subsequent risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events. It is possible that depression is only a marker for more severe CVD which so far cannot be detected using our currently available investigations. However, given the increased prevalence of depression in patients with CVD, a causal relationship with either CVD causing more depression or depression causing more CVD and a worse prognosis for CVD is probable. There are many possible pathogenetic mechanisms that have been described, which are plausible and that might well be important. However, whether or not there is a causal relationship, depression is the main driver of quality of life and requires prevention, detection, and management in its own right. Depression after an acute cardiac event is commonly an adjustment disorder than can improve spontaneously with comprehensive cardiac management. Additional management strategies for depressed cardiac patients include cardiac rehabilitation and exercise programmes, general support, cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressant medication, combined approaches, and probably disease management programmes. © The Author 2013.},

They then consider new ethical issues in mental disorders presented by these risks, including within-family conflicts over genetic testing; effects of genetic discoveries on stigma, abortion, preimplantation procedures, and population screening for susceptibility; and genetic tests as a factor in marital choice.{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: New structural mutations (de novo copy number variants [CNVs], which are chromosomal microdeletions and micro-duplications) are present in 4\%27\% of patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ASD and can occur almost anywhere in the genome. For a person with a de novo CNV, the absolute risk of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ASD is 14\%, much higher than the population risk. Rare CNVs have also been identified that are generally not new mutations but constitute very high-effect risk factors, ranging up to 82\%.{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: A substantial minority of patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and ASD have high-impact detectable genetic events.

Aims To evaluate the evidence of effectiveness of psychological treatments in treating depression and anxiety in people with dementia and MCI. Method We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological treatment versus usual care in people with dementia and MCI. Primary outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, ability to perform daily activities, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognition and caregivers' self-rated depressive symptoms. Results We included six RCTs, involving 439 participants with dementia, which used cognitive-behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, counselling or multimodal interventions including a specific psychological therapy. We found beneficial effects for both depression and anxiety. Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate for depression and low for anxiety, due to the methodological limitations of the studies we identified and the limited number of trials. Conclusions The evidence from six RCTs suggests that psychological treatments are effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety for people with dementia. There is a need for high-quality, multicentre trials including standardised, well-defined interventions.},

A review of Hill's criteria for causality and random effects meta-analysis were conducted of prospective, population-based studies examining anxiety and incident CVD in people free from CVD at baseline. RESULTS: The meta-analysis comprised 37 papers (n = 1 565 699). The follow-up ranged from 1 to 24 years. Anxiety was associated with a 52\% increased incidence of CVD (hazard ratio = 1.52, 95\% CI 1.36-1.71). The risk seemed independent of traditional risk factors and depression. The evaluation of Hill's criteria largely argued in favour of causality. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety may be of interest for CVD prevention.

Aims To investigate using a meta-analytical approach whether the excess of non-right-handedness is seen in both females and males, and also when handedness is assessed behaviourally. Method Electronic databases were searched for studies that reported (a) the rate of female and male non-right-handers in schizophrenia compared with controls and (b) the rate of non-right-handers in schizophrenia (regardless of gender) based on behavioural handedness assessment. Results The odds ratios (ORs) for females (OR = 1.63; based on 621 patients, 3747 controls) and males (OR = 1.50; based on 1213 patients, 3800 controls) differed significantly from 1.0, indicating both female and male patients were more often non-right-handed than controls. Moreover, there was an excess of non-right-handedness in patients with schizophrenia when handedness was assessed behaviourally: OR = 1.84 (1255 patients, 6260 controls). Even when both gender and behavioural handedness assessment were controlled for simultaneously, the excess of non-right-handedness persisted. Conclusions The findings clearly demonstrate that the excess of non-right-handedness in schizophrenia does not result from a gender artefact or from biased handedness questionnaires. It is a true empirical effect and may indeed reflect a genetic link between schizophrenia and brain lateralisation.},
