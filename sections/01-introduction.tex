Thermal properties of a given material are essential in determining many significant properties. This can include calculating the heats of formations, Gibbs free energy and the possibility of certain reactions occurring. Up till the last century, we were restricted to these properties derived from experiments. This presents obvious problems with scale, time and feasibility. However, computational chemistry, specifically quantum mechanical modeling and the various approximations thereof, have made it possible to calculate these properties to a reasonable level of accuracy.

In this paper, we will be using a computational approach to calculate enthalpies of three reactions and compare the results across multiple different approximations.
