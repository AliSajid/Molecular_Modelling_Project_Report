To summarize, computational investigation of thermodynamic properties of reactions has become increasingly easy to achieve. It can be done with a reasonable degree of accuracy without losing too much time as well. This is a result of decades of mathematical development in the fields of Schrodinger equation and the advancements like Density Functional Theory.
